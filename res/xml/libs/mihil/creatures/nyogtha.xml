			<name>Extend Strands</name>
			<count>1</count>
			<description>Nyogtha extends or retracts six thin, sticky tendrils from its body. While the strands are extended, Nyogtha takes a -4 circumstance penalty to Stealth checks, and while they're retracted, it can't use its strand Strikes.</description>

		<feat>
			<name>Flurry of Strands</name>
			<count>1</count>
			<description>Nyogtha makes a strand Strike with each of its strands (except those that are immobilizing creatures). Each attack must be against a different target. These attacks count toward Nyogtha's multiple attack penalty, but its multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the attacks.</description>

		<feat>
			<name>Pull the Strands</name>
			<count>2</count>
			<description>Nyogtha pulls every creature grabbed by its strands toward itself. Nyogtha rolls a single Athletics check and compares the results to each immobilized creature's Fortitude DC. Nyogtha pulls each creature it succeeds against up to 25 feet closer and each creature it critically succeeds against up to 50 feet closer.</description>

		<feat>
			<name>Sticky Strand</name>
			<count>passive</count>
			<description>Any ncreature hit by Nyogtha's strand is enfeebled 1 and grabbed. Each additional hit from a strand increases the enfeebled condition value by 1 (to a maximum of enfeebled 4). The enfeebled value decreases by 1 every 8 hours. Nyogtha can move while it has a creature grabbed with a strand, but it automatically releases the creature if it moves beyond the strand's reach. Nyogtha can release a grabbed creature as a free action. A creature can sever a strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals at least 18 slashing damage. This doesn't deal any damage to Nyogtha herself, though it can no longer attack with a severed strand. If all strands are severed, Nyogtha is reduced to 0 hit points.</description>
