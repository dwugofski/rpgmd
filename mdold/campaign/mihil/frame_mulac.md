[[title|Framing Mulac|4]]

[[import|mihil|./mihil]]

[[l|Pela|Pela|mihil]] believes the next step in the plan is to eliminate [[l|Kobil Hau|Kobil|mihil]]'s support for [[l|Mulac|Mulac|mihil]]. Her plan is to blow up the Domestic Magisterium building with Kobil inside, using a remote-detonation bomb. At the scene of the crime will be placed Mulac's favorite magic brooch, which he always carries with him to bring him luck. As well, dust and debris from the Domestic Magisterium's cellar will be placed on Mulac's boots as further evidence, and forged documents will be left which incriminate Mulac as having falsified quota records for personal gain and a suggestion that Kobil is close to catching onto the ruse.

# Preparing for the Mission

## Planning the Attack

It will take 3 days for Pela to plan the attack, gather resources, and coordinate agents. She will ask the party to wait in the city while she gathers resources and planning the entry, in case they are needed for the infiltration. When she is ready, she will contact them again.

If the party alerted the guards during the "Leveraging Kinata Tabai" mission, consider adding to the reason for the delay either A) her needing time to reevaluate the method of entrance due to an uptick in guards, or B) her waiting for the guard presence to cool down before moving (though, ultimately, she needs to act after 3 days to avoid being discovered). Also consider having her comment that their failure is why they are not going to be needed to retrieve the brooch.

## Testing the Party

During their waiting, one time when they are all together, Pela will use one of her rings of disguise to approach them disguised as a male stone elf Domestic Magistrate (Inquisitor) named [[a|Kengraml]]. Kengraml is a tall, thin middle-aged elven man with long sleek black hair greying around the temples. A pronounced scar on the left corner of his mouth gives him a perpetual smirk, and when he speaks it become clear several of his teeth on that side have been replaced with gold. He wears a dark cloak with the hood up, and uses it to cover the uniform of a Domestic Magistrate (`DC 15 Perception Check` to notice).

Kengraml is there to see if the party will betray Pela and the Jaguar Slayers. He will imply that he knows the party is there to get to the Japethan Forge, based on their actions in the Scarlet Oak Tree, and would be willing to assist them. All he asks in return is for knowledge of the Jaguar Slayer's whereabouts and plans in Mihil. He knows the Jaguar Slayers were responsible for the burglary of Kinata, and claims to fear their plans for Mihil could put innocent lives in jeopardy. 

Kengraml will be coy in his interrogation, not expressing displeasure if they do not say anything against Pela, only disappointment. Pela is excellent at what she does, and any attempt to discern that Kengraml is anything other than who he says he is will require taking the `Sense Motive action (DC 35)`. On a success, they only learn that Kengraml is being deceptive about who he is. On a critical success, they are able to determine that Kengraml is actually Pela in disguise.

If the party betrays Pela during this exchange, she will scatter the Jaguar Slayer cell in the city and leave a note expressing her disappointment with the party, but outlining the location of the Japethan Forge all the same, since she believes the threat to Mihil comes from there and the party is needed to stop it.

## Infiltrating the Domestic Magisterium

After the three days, Kinata will contact the party with a Sending spell. When the party arrives, they see Pela engaged in a fiery debate with Bitol.

Either due to the party's alerting the guards during the "Leveraging Kinata Tabai" mission or due to one of Pela's agents getting discovered during the execution of their duties, Kinata believes a direct approach to the Domestic Magisterium building is impossible. Pela investigated the old records and history of the building and learned that it was once the Hall of Orezen, a monument built to commemorate the elf who welcomed the Shalebiters of old into Mihil. The Hall of Orezen was connected to the Hall of Kimgrathl, which was the original holdkeep of Mihil.

A few decades after the formation of the Mihil hold, the holdkeep was infiltrated by Lanulan agents who slaughtered the ruler and his family in an effort to sow discord between the two halves of Mihil. Modern Mihilans believe the Hall of Kimgrathl has been haunted ever since by the anguished souls of those killed. However, Pela discovered that originally the Hall was restored after the assassinations, and the Hall of Orezen and Hall of Kimgrathl were converted into museums to honor and reinforce the bond between the two halves of the city. 

Looking into the records of the buildings, Pela discovered that they were originally connected by an elevator that would allow Orezen and Kimgrathl to discretely travel to the other's home to discuss political issues. Pela believes that elevator remains and, in order to keep people from discovering it (while still having it as an escape route in case of danger), the Domestic Magisterium has sealed the passage and created the haunting to keep the citizens of Mihil out.

Pela believes the party should use this passage to infiltrate the Domestic Magisterium (it should let out in the cellar, an untrafficed area in the building where the bomb needs to be placed), and place the bomb. Bitol believes the curse of that place is far too dangerous to send anyone. He refuses to send any of his agents in, and Pela is unable to go herself (she needs to remain at the base to coordinate efforts across her agents) or send any of her agents (they are and, being spies, would not be useful in a heavy fight anyway). This leaves the party.

She will give them the [[l|bomb|The Bomb]] and Mulac&rsquo;s [[l|brooch|The Brooch]].

### The Bomb

The bomb is a palm-sized spherical iron shell with no discernable seals. A character who passes a `DC 30 Trained Crafting` check can recall knowledge on the likely construction of the device. Given that it is remotely detonated, there is likely a small vial of mercury at the core of the device to connect it to the detonator. The vial is likely capped with a small golden rod. Inside the bomb is likely a thin metal shell holding a combination of carbon, saltpeter, finely ground ruby and unakite, and small pieces of metal shrapnel. Between that inner shell and the thicker outer barrier is likely a layer of metal beads surrounded by a similar powder mixture as the inner core, but with a heavier concentration of ruby and/or unakite.

If this construction is correct, the detonation is triggered by conducting a burst of axiopyschogenic matter into the connected well of mercury&mdash;not a huge amount, but significantly more than the trickle required to maintain the link between mercury pools. This will charge the ruby and unakite in the inner shell. Some of the carbon dust will have been structured so that the ruby will heat up, causing the saltpetre to combust, creating an intese outward pressure within the inner shell. The remaining carbon dust will have been structured so that the unakite will enhance the physical pressure of the expanding saltpetre. This will cause an explosive pressure within the core.

When the core bursts, the outer layer of metal beads will act as further shrapnel to increase the explosive effect. As well, the carbon in the outer core will have been structure to create two effects. First, the unakite will convert a small portion of the shrapnel's kinetic energy back into axipsychogenic matter. Then, that matter will be conducted to the ruby dust, which will combust violently, creating an incendiary dust that is spread with the shrapnel.

Depending on the desired effect&mdash;explosive radius vs. incendiary intensity&mdash;the formulations of ruby and unkanite dust can be modified to favor one effect over the other. These devices are exceptionally expensive to make, and often it is cheaper to achieve a greater effect with more mundane components, though such tactics require significantly larger explosives.

### The Brooch

Mulac&rsquo;s brooch is magical. It is a circular shape with dwaven motifs around the edge and the dwarven ideograph of "Kolograk" (Mulac&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name) emblazoned in the center. The structure is mostly gold, with some copper rimming and an aluminum backing. The center piece is backed with blue-green matrix opal, with the ideograph and motifs layered on top in gold.

A character who passes a `DC 25 Trained Crafting` check can recall knowledge on the function of the amulet. On a success, the character learns that the blue-green matrix opal likely means the brooch is responsible for instilling a sense of deferential trust in another person when used. It is the same as a Diplomat&rsquo;s Badge, except that it also bestows a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks and does not have the Diplomat&rsquo;s Badge&rsquo;s Activate ability.

Additionally, the item&rsquo;s back aluminum plating likely makes it more resistant to damage.

# The Hall of Kimgrathl

## Overview

### History

Long ago the Hall of Kimgrathl served as the holdkeep for the Mountainheart Hold. However, before the completion of the Orezen-Kimgrathl Locks, in an effort to sow discord between the upper and lower halves of Mihil, the holdkeep was infiltrated by Lanulan agents who slaughtered Kimgrathl and residents of the keep. No one living inside the keep escaped the massacre that night.

Despite the best efforts of the assassins, the dwarves of Mihil did not believe that the surface elves atop them were responsible. They saw the Orezen's genuine mourning for their former clanchief, and the bloody night strengthened the unity between the two halves of the city.

To honor the founders of the united city, they repurposed the former holdkeep into a hall of honor, with statues, carvings, relics and memorabilia in honor of [[l|Kimgrathl Shalebiter-Mountainheart|Kimgrathl|mihil]] and [[l|Orezen Chiniluthl|Orezen|mihil]]. They created the Hall of Kimgrathl. The elves did the same on the surface, turning their old palace above the hall into the Hall of Orezen (Now the headquarters for the [[l|Domestic Magisterium|Domestic Magisterium|mihil]]).

### Modern Day

When the Atzivecan Empire claimed Mihil, they sought to divide Mihil so they could more effectively control it. They claimed the Hall of Orezen for their Domestic Magisterium and looted much of the Hall of Kimgrathl. While raiding the Undercity's hall, they found a secret elevator connecting the two halls. Not wanting people to use the secret passage to enter their headquarters, the Domestic Magisterium corrupted the hall.

They conjured the ghosts of the dead to scare away any intruders, but most of these spectral summons are simply echos of the people, with no real memories. To prevent even brave adventurers from exploring the hall, they created a seal on one of the doors to the elevator, and divided the key into four parts. Each part was guarded by a horrible monstrocity bound to one of the few real ghosts in the hall: those who died in such a state that their ghosts retain an element of sentience. These monstrocities would attack any interlopers, but would grant access to any magistrate who needed to use the secret passageway.

Over time, the ancient significance of the Hall of Kimgrathl became lost. People only knew it for the horrors and ghosts that now haunt it. Now, none dare tread the halls for fear of the wrenching terror that legends say await all those who enter.

### Dungeon Progression

When the party enters the Grand Hallway ([[l|Area 1]]), they will be confronted by the ghost of Kimgrathl and his guards. There, he will tell the party about the monsters who have possessed the ghosts of the hall and the seal on the door to [[l|Area 15]]. After defeating the four monsters (possibly killing the ghosts they possess too), the seal is broken and the party can make their way to the Domestic Magisterium headquarters.

### The Corrupted

This dungeon contains four monstrocities that form the seal to the door to area 15. Each one is a formidable foe in a normal fight, but the party will have the option to try to rescue the soul the creature is siphoning the life from in order to save the soul. It will make the encounter more difficult, but not impossible. When the party encounters one of the corrupted, feel free to outline at least one option to try to save the soul from the corrupted. Freeing a soul causes it to fade into the mists with a smile on its face. When the party is [[l|Speaking with Kimgrathl]], he will give the names and locations of the corrupted.

When a corrupted is defeated, their corpse disintegrates into a ribbon of inky blackness. That riboon streams towards the seal on the door in [[a|Area 14]] to Area 15, and it completes a section of the inscription. The filling is proportional, so once at least one section has been filled, it is clear there are four sections to the inscription. In Voidex (Aklo) it reads:

* ([[l|The Corrupted Son]]) Just as
* ([[l|The Corrupted Advisor]]) our Master
* ([[l|The Corrupted Guard Captain]]) tought us
* ([[l|The Corrupted Smith]]) to do

Once the inscription is filled, the seal glows with a dark green light. A `DC 15 Occultism` check confirms this is a seal that is primed to be broken once touched, though some seals have been known to be trapped. The seal is a level 9 Abjuration magical effect (`DC 29` to counteract) when forms a barrier of force that prevents a person from walking through the door or teleporting into [[a|Area 15]]. If a person touches the completed seal, it breaks and folds in ontself to manifest a <span class="reward">Pendant of the Occult</span>, with the text of the inscription faintly inside.

If a corrupted is killed while holding the ghost it trapped, it lets out a wailing scream as it is pulled along with the corrupted into the seal. Any creature wearing the resulting Pendant of the Occult while sleeping has a cumulative 5% per ghost chance of having a nightmare that night in which one or more of the trapped ghosts begs the creature to release them. A similar effect happens whenever a creature uses the pendant.

Once the seal is broken (whether by completing the inscription or through some form of dispelling magic), a creature then may open the doors and may teleport into [[a|Area 15]] as desired. As well, the misasma, ghosts, and corrupted disappear. The curse on the Hall of Kimgrathl is broken, and the party receives <span class="reward">84 XP (Moderate Accomplishment)</span>.

## Rooms

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/mihil/02_Kimgrathl_Burrow_GM.png|The Hall of Kimgrathl|borderless|../../../res/img/campaign/mihil/02_Kimgrathl_Burrow_players.png]]

### Area 1

[[a|The Grand Hallway]]

When the party enters the hall, read the following to them:

> As you enter the keep, the room before you bursts alight as several braziers ignite with a cold blue flame. Mist overflows the braziers and pools at the floor of the room in a fog. Each brazier is at the base of a massive stone pillar, and as the flames lick up the supports, you notice several carvings depicting dwarves and elves building, fighting, and working together.

A `DC 15 Lore` check will reveal that this is a depiction of the history of Mihil starting with the arrival of the Shalebiters, focusing on the cooperation between the dwarves and elves.

If the party walks into the center of the room, 4 Dwarven Ghost Palace Guards (80 XP) will appear around them, led by Kimgrathl's ghost (a Dwarven Ghost Noble). Kimgrathl orders the party to leave, and the palace guards will engage the party to push them back while Kimgrathl stands behind them, not engaging in the fight. If the party defeats the guards or sufficiently harms Kimgrathl, he will speak with the party.

[[a|Speaking with Kimgrathl]]: See [[l|Area 13.A]] for a description of Kimgrathl. If Kimgrathl is impressed by the party's fighting prowess, he will ask why they have come into his hall. He knows of the curse the Domestic Magistrates have put upon the hall (see [[l|Area 14]]), and wishes to end the suffering of his friends and family by ending the curse. He knows each monster is feeding off the fears of the ghost, forcing them to live in a personal nightmare. The people being tortured by the curse of [[l|The Corrupted]] are his

* Son, [[a|Ulgrathem]] (m dw a; [[l|The Corrupted Son]]), in his chambers to the northern end of the hall ([[l|Area 13.E]])
	* Ulgrathem was Kimgrathl&rsquo;s eldest son, born two years before the move to Mihil.
	* Ulgrathem always viewed himself as the black sheep of the family. Whereas his parents were adventurous, heroic icons, he was a shy and introverted scholar, more interested in studying old lore than slaying monsters or leading people. He viewed himself as a disappointement in his parents&rsquo; shadows, and always feared they felt similarly, giving more attention to his sister, who Ulgrathem was sure would be Kimgrathl's chosen successor, not that he truly wanted the position anyway. In truth, both his parents appreciated and loved his inquisitive, acute mind, but Ulgrathem only saw his physical weakness.
* Advisor, [[a|Juleth]] (f dw ma; [[l|The Corrupted Advisor]]), in the library to the south east corner of the hall ([[l|Area 7]])
	* Juleth was Kimgrathl's right hand during the establishment of the Mountainheart hold. She was the engineering mind behind the Orezen-Kimgrathl Locks, and she was the central authority organizing their construction. 
	* Juleth suffered from imposter syndrome. She was constantly paranoid that her claims to Kimgrathl that she could create the locks was simply blustering on her part. She worried that she had simply conned Kimgrathl into believing in her. She feared that, at any moment, the mountain of problems and difficulties she was constantly working to keep resolved and maintained would overwhelm her, and that she would let Kimgrathl down. She never lived to see her work completed.
* Guard captain, [[a|Hezela]] (f dw ma; [[l|The Corrupted Guard Captain]]), in the barracks to the north of the entry hall ([[l|Area 11.C]])
	* Hezela was Kimgrathl's first lieutenant during the migration. He personally trained and groomed her as his replacement. In Mihil, Kimgrathl too busy overseeing the construction of the new hold to personally manage the guards and troops needed to secure the construction sites, so Hezela was largely in charge by herself.
	* Hezela always felt that her soldiers only looked at her as a lesser to the legendary Kimgrathl, and that she neither had nor deserved their respect. Her fears were unfounded, but she always felt on the verge of letting her soldiers down. Ultimately every guard in the hall that night fought with the certainty that, were they to die, there is no one they would rather die fighting with.
* Smith, [[a|Irikag]] (m dw ma; [[l|The Corrupted Smith]]), in his smithy through the kitchens to the southwest and then further west ([[l|Area 10]])
	* Irikag was a close childhood friend to Kimgrathl. He was always more of a craftsman than a fighter, but, drawn in by Kimgrathl's inspiring personality, joined the guard with his friend. After a couple of years of wistful patroling with Kimgrathl, Irikag lost the use of his legs in a skirmish with some orcs. His impairment excused him to find true purpose as a craftsman, and he quickly established himself as the Shalebiter Forgemaster, ultimately leaving with Kimgrathl to become the Mountainheart Forgemaster and main engineer for the hold.
	* Requiring the use of mechanically-augmented legs to walk, Irikag always worried that the first thing anyone saw of him was his machinery. He always worried that one aspect defined him as a person to others, and that no matter how much he achieved, his mechanical legs would be the first and last thing people remembered about him. 

He knows that the magistrates have unleashed beasts to feed off of the ghosts of those close to him, and tells the party that the only way to reach the elevator is to kill those monsters. He asks the party not to harm the ghosts themselves, though, as if they die in the grasp of the monsters he fears their souls will be forever lost. Kimgrathl knows of the secret passages in areas 8 and 10, but does not inform the party as he wants them to free his friends and family and end the curse on the keep. It would take a `DC 28 Diplomacy` check to convince him to tell them.

### Area 2

[[a|The Throne Room|Throne Room]]

> 	An imposing stone throne stands over the room atop a short flight of steps. A tall dwarven-styled stained glass window fills the wall behind it, depicting two cities--one in a valley atop the other underground--and a clan of dwarves with the Mountainheart insignia standing under it. On the left side of the main illustration stands another clan of dwarves with a different insignia, and on the right side of the illustration stands a group of elves, with their own family crest.
	
> Filling the room, several dwarven figures fade in and out of form from the silver-blue miasma on the floor. Some seem to be dancing, or engrossed in some feast. Some are servants, milling about their chores. Some are guards, patrolling or standing at their post. No figure maintains their form for longer than a moment, but the constant shifting of forms stirs the mist into a vaporous sea.

This room was the throne room for Kimgrathl. Here, he would hold council with his advisors, feasts with his friends, and court with his citizens. Now, the ghosts of the old holdkeep wander too and fro, trapped in the mundane cycle of their old lives and ignorant of the world of the living around them.

[[a|Window Iconography]]: The central illustration in the stained glass window clearly depicts Mihil and the Mountainheart dwarves. The right illustration shows the Shalebiter dwarves, and a `DC 20 Lore` check reveals the insignia is that of the Shalebiter clan. Similarly, the left illustration shows the ancient elves of Mihil, led by Orezen. A `DC 20 Lore` check reveals the main elf is Orezen and the crest is that of the ancient (pre-9th era) leaders of Mihil.

### Area 3

[[a|The Guest Wing]]

#### Area 3.A

> Dim blue-flames light this long hallway, floating above torchless sconces. The ghosts of maids and guards stir up the mist as they move purposefully about.

#### Area 3.B

> Several empty shelves and barren, broken display cases line the walls of the room. In the center of the room is a large, circular stone mirror, about 6 feet in diameter, with dwarvish writing along the top rim of the mirror frame and elvish writing along the bottom. Behind the mirror, a thin line of metal forms a wide circle about 10 feet in diameter.

[[a|Mirror Writing]]: A character who can read elvish or dwarvish recognizes the relevant script as saying, "In the name of friendship, the city of Mihil was forged."

[[a|The Magic Mirror Projection]]: The mirror is a sort of magic mirror. While most magic mirrors allow someone to divine specific locations, this mirror works purely through mercury to display a pre-recorded "video" message. When the magic word ("friendship" in either dwarvish or elvish) is spoken, the wheel behind the mirror begins to spin as gears behind the frame move it. The ring has small illustrations carved into it, and, once the ring reaches a certain speed, the mirror activates, using a mercury-coated lens at the bottom to present the images as an animation.

The animation starts as illustrations of dwarves and elves working together to create a massive damn in a mountain valley. It zooms over them to a male elf and dwarf standing atop a mountain overlooking them. The perspective then moves onto a massive city in a higher-up valley, which is clearly Mihil, bustling with dwarves and elves, and then progresses underground, to the undercity of Mihil, showing more dwarves and elves.

As the part watches the illustration, however, it starts to melt and ripple, and the mirror resumes its flat, reflective surface while the wheel still spins behind it. Initially it showes them as they are, but ghosts suddenly surrond them and tear, gnash, and stab into them, ripping them apart in a bloody gore.

### Area 3.C

> The room appears empty, with several cabinets and curious barren and broken open.

As the party enters the room, read the following:

> The form of two ghosts quickly materializes in the center of the room. In the blink of an eye, one of the ghosts stabs the other through the neck, and both ghosts vanish in falling vapor.

### Area 3.D

> Several bas reliefs have been carved into the walls, though several large gouging scratches have marred the depiction.

[[a|Reflief Depiction]]: With a `DC 17 Lore` check, the character can determine that the reliefs are elven in nature. A `DC 15 Perception` check reveals that the figures in the relief are exchanging gifts.

[[a|Wall Scratches]]: Examining the scratches on the wall requires a `DC 20 Perception` check to determine there are two sets of scratches. While both appear to have been made by claws, one set appears too regular and too consistent not to have been made with some form of metallic tool or weapon.

In fact, the metallic set has been made by the corrupted smith in [[l|Area 10]] while the more organic set has been made by the corrupted son in [[l|Area 13.E]].

### Area 4

[[a|The Feast Hall]]

> This room is filled with what at first resembles elegant drapery from the ceiling to each of the walls. A closer look, however, reveals the "drapery" is in fact a century's worth of accumulated cobwebs. At the center, an enormous, 50-foot-long table stretches the length of the room. The sides of the room are decorated with plinths and stands, clearly meant to display something, but each one stands empty.

### Area 5

[[a|The Kitchen]]

> You enter a small kitchen, empty of cooking utensils or cutlery, but filled with mist as the ghosts of servants appear briefly conducting chores and tasks.

### Area 6

[[a|The Liesure Room]]

> The furniture and decoration for this room has been smashed and lays on the floor in pieces. From the mists, various ghosts appear sitting in front of an empty hearth on the western side of the room. While mostly obscured by the blue miasma, some of the pockets of dispersed mist reveal the floor is littered with small scraps of paper, as well as several metal-nibbed pens.

The floor is covered with the shed skin and teeth of the corrupted advisor from [[l|Area 7]]. Touching or examining the nibs reveals they are razor sharp. A pair of double doors to the east remains slightly ajar.

### Area 7

[[a|The Library]]

> Rows of broken bookshelves and ruined books line a long hallway leading to central library and reading area. A large mound of books and papers fill the center of the room. No mist or ghosts appear here.

[[a|The Corrupted Advisor]]: This monster is one of [[l|The Corrupted]], and once the party makes itself know, they will have to fight [[enc|mihil:corrupted_advisor(1)|5|5]]. The corrupted advisor is a giant two-headed snake made of woven paper and books, with fangs made from bundles of razor-sharp metal-nibbed pens. One head partially swallowing the advisor, [[l|Juleth]], its fangs piercing her torso. A party member can use an Interact action to make a `DC 23 Athletics` check to pry open the mouth. Once the mouth is open, a party member can use another Interact action to pull the advisor's ghost out.

If the advisor is removed from the monster, the monster is able to use two actions to make two fangs Strikes at once, possibly at different targets. Both Strikes use the same multiattack penalty, and they count as two attacks when calculating its multiple attack penalty. 

[[a|The Library Secret Passage]]: A stone bookshelf opens up a passageway to [[a|Area 8]]. The party can find it with a `DC 25 Perception` check while searching for anything of value among the shelves in that area. 

### Area 8

This area is a long, dark hallway stretching from [[a|Area 7]] to [[a|Area 15]]. It is unlit. About halfway through the hallway, a <span class="encounter">Scythe Blade Hazard (Lv 4 Hazard: 40 XP)</span> is present (`DC 23` to detect).

### Area 9

[[a|Servants Quarters]]

> An assortment of housekeeping items: laundry basins, sewing equipment, and janitorial tools decorate the room. They are arranged in a neat, organized fashion, through they are not spared from the dust and cobwebs that blanket the rest of the room, and several ghosts materialize to mime working with the equipment. Arranged throughout the quarters are several beds, each of which has a plaque above its head, though the plaques have each been marred by scratches and are illegible.

### Area 10

[[a|The Smithy]]

> An enormous chamber with a 20 foot high ceiling stretches out before and to either side of you. Smithing eqiupment is scattered about the area, and an enormous forge oven fills the southern end of the chamber. In the center of the room, a heap of rusty scrap metal has been haphazardly piled together. No mist or ghosts appear here.

When a living creature steps into the room, the forge's fires burst alight, filling the room with an omni-present red glow. [[l|The Corrupted Smith]] then shambles together and attacks the party.

[[a|The Corrupted Smith]]: This monster is one of [[l|The Corrupted]], and once the party enters the room, they will have to fight [[enc|mihil:corrupted_smith(1)|5|5]]. The corrupted smith is a towering suit of cobbled-together rusty metal scraps, with crucible and furnace at its base. In the exposed center of the suit is Kimgrathl's smith, [[l|Irikag]]. He is bound to the frame by razor wire that cut into his skin as he appears to bleed around them. 

During the fight, a party member within range of the monster may use an Interact action to jump onto the monster. This will require making an `Acrobatics or Atheltics check against its Reflex DC (20)`. On a success, the creature is immobilized and on the monster, but flat-footed to attacks from it. On a failure, it simply falls to the ground, and, on a critical failure, it falls prone. A creature on or grappling the monster may use a Release (free) action to drop off the monster, but, if it cannot fly, it must succeed a `DC 15 Reflex` save or fall prone when it lands. Otherwise a creature must use an Interact action to climb off the monster.

Any creature on or grappling the corrupted smith is affected by its Burn Alive ability. While on or grappling the monster, a party member may use a Strike action to cut one of the wires holding Irikag to the frame. When attacked in this manner, the wisres have `15 AC, 1 HP`, and otherwise the same stats as the corrupted smith. On a critical hit, the damage is applied to two wires, cutting both if possible. A creature may attempt to cut a wire by Striking the statue without being on or grappling the statue, but the attacking creature suffers a -5 circumstance penalty to the attack, the wires use the AC of the monster, and no damage is inflicted against the monster on a hit.

Once at least 5 wires have been cut, Irikag can be released from the frame. A creature may use an Interact option to pull him free from the frame.

### Area 11

[[a|The Guards' Wing]]

#### Area 11.A

[[a|The Guard Captain's Quaters]]

> A statue of a heavily armored dwarven woman stands in the center of this chamber. A plaque stands at the base, but it has been scratched out to illegibility.

This chamber was the quarters of the guard captain, [[l|Hezela]], and the statue in the middle of the room depicts her. Anyone who has seen [[l|The Corrupted Guard Captain]] would recognize her, though she looks more heroic and dignified in this depiction. 

#### Area 11.B

[[a|The Guard Lieutenant's Quarters]]

> In the center of this chamber, the metal statue of an armored dwarven man stands holding the hand of a male dwarven child to his side. The man's head has been cut off, and lays almost entirely obscured in the mists, its depiction entirely obscured. Hiding behind the statue, you manage to catch a glimpse of the ghost of a dwarven child peeking out from the statue. As soon as you meet the child's eyes, it darts fully behind the statue.

If a creature scans the room from the entryway, they can make a `DC 16 Perception` check. On a success, the creature sees the ghost of a small dwarven boy hiding behind the statue. Any creature who walks around the statue sees the same without a check. The boy is the same as the one depicted in the statue. Gemen is shy and will try to hide from the party as best he can. Attempting to get the boy to open up to them (e.g. through a Make an Impression action) requires a `DC 18` check, but any creature exceptionally taller than a dwarf suffers a -5 circumstance penalty, as the boy is afraid of elves and any who look like them.

[[a|The Ghost Boy's Story]]: The boy is [[a|Gemen]], son of [[a|Kargrath]]. When the hall fell, Kargrath was the guard lieutenant under [[l|Hezela]]. Kargrath was the inside man who allowed the Lanulan agents into Kimgrathl. As the castle's invasion was beginning, Kargrath tried to get Hezela to join with him and help serve Lanul. She refused, so Kargrath stabbed her in the back. Ultimately, the Lanulan agents turned on Kargrath, killing him and his son.

Gemen is one of the few true ghosts in the hall, and he recalls these events from a child's eyes. He saw his father confront the guard captain, and, when she tried run away, he killed her. Then his father sat with him while screams and shoutes were ringing throughout the castle, comforting the boy and telling him everything would be all right. Then, when some &lsdquo;tall men&rsquo; (elven Lanulan agents) came into the room, they killed his father when he tried to speak with them. They then approached Gemen, and that his the last he remembers.

#### Area 11.C

[[a|The Barracks]]

> A long chamber flanked on both sides by numerous beds, with a few dusty and bewebbed broken tables on either end. The repulsive scent of death permeates the room and flows out from it, though no source is apparent. The beds and their linens are clean, and the lumpy profile makes it appear as though each bed is occupied. No mist or ghosts appear here.

[[a|The Corrupted Guard Captain]]: When the party pulls aside one of the bed sheets, they will see the rotting corpse of an armored guard, but deformed like melted wax. Pulling aside a sheet will trigger the encounter with the [[enc|mihil:corrupted_guard_captain(1)|5|5]]. The guard captain begins unformed in the southern end of the hall, and is paralyzed until it is. Instead of other actions, on each of its turns it will pull the corpses in the beds in the room into itself. When doing so, roll 1d4 for each corpse in a bed. On a 2 or higher, that corpse flies to the monster.

Each corpse has `AC 15 and 10 Hp`, but otherwise has the same stats as the corrupted guard captain. Any damage inflicted on a corpse is inflicted on the monster as well, though only up to 10 Hp. Killing one of the corpses does not stop its limbs from merging with the corrupted guard captain. 

When fully formed, the corrupted guard captain appears as a mass of writhing limbs and faces melting together into a shifting pool of flesh, held together by an exoskeleton of the guards&rsquo; armor. A tangle of irregular legs barely hold up the bulks central mass of the monster, and two hulking arms&mdash;themselves made of arms&mdash;reach out to either side, ending with two pinscers made of teeth and sharpened bone. Several arms and hands reach out from gaps in the chest armor, with claw-like nails dripping with black ichor. At the head of the mass is the form of [[l|Hezela]], who is held by grabbing hands and strips of flesh.

Hezela can be pulled from the mass, but it requires first using an Interact action to grab onto Hezela, which requires a `DC 28 Athletics` check. On a success, the creature is bitten by mouths that form in the body. It takes damage from the monster&rsquo;s Gnashing Mouths and is exposed to the monster's Paralytic Venom. Then, to drag Hezela out, the creature must take the Interact action to make another `DC 28 Athletics` check. If the creature critically succeeded on the first Athletics check, it gains a +5 circumstance bonus to the second check.

As long as Hezela is within 10 feet of the monster, it can reach out with its tentacle-like arms to grab her, making an `Athletics check against the carrying creature's Athletics DC` to pull her free and reintegrate her into itself. On critical success, it pulls her free, exposes the target to its paralytic venom, and deals its Mandibles damage against the target. On a success, it pulls her free and exposes the target to the venom. On a failure, it only exposes the target to its venom. On a critical failure, it does not expose the target to its venom.

### Area 12

[[a|Guard's Mess]]

> A large chamber stretches out to either side, with several stone tables arranged with stone benches for eating. At the eastern end of the chamber, a section has been cornered off for a small kitchen. Images of ghosts briefly appear in uniform armor to sit and take their meals.

This area served as the mess hall for the guards during their shift.

#### Area 12.A

[[a|Mess Pantry]]

> A small room with dusty crates and broken shelves.

### Area 13

[[a|Family Wing]]

Each of the rooms in this hall belonged to a member of the presiding family.

#### Area 13.A

[[a|The Master Bedroom|Master Bedroom]]

> An extravegant bedroom arranged with a fireplace, a stone bedframe, and furniture which, based on the frames, were likely comfortable when they were upholstered. Agains the northern wall, two suits of rusted, ruined armor stand. One male-fitting set ornately bears the Nupumab of the Shalebiter-Mountainheart clan, while the other is fitted for a woman and has a much simpler design. The hearth burns with a cool blue flame. Every so often, the image of Kimgrathl, seated in one of the fireside chairs, briefly manifests.

[[a|Kimgrathl|Kimgrathl's Appearance]]: Kimgrathl was a bald dwarven man with a long red braided beard running down to his belt. He had the look of a man just starting to show his age. His weary eyes and slightly-greying beard hinted at years his smooth face hid. When he died, he was wearing the uniform of his office (the Nupumab): a set of ornate metallic pauldrons which fit over the shoulders similar to a capelet, ending at the mid chest and leaving the arms bare, with a short cape off to the right side. On the right should was engraved the symbol of the Mountainheart clan, while the left bore the symbol of the Shalebiter clan. Underneath the pauldrons he was wearing some lamellar armor and thick, plain cotton clothes, with sturdy metal-capped leather boots.

In the Shalebiter Clan, Kimgrathl was a guard captain responsible for patroling the surface around their hold entrances to ensure their territory remained secure from would-be orc raiders. Kimgrathl was a natural leader: well-liked by almost all, and possessed of a fierce sense of courage and integrity which inspired loyalty and faith in those under him. Growing up, Kimgrathl always enjoyed facing difficult challenges and rising to meet them, and he instilled that same thirst for growth and excellence in his soldiers.

Meeting [[l|Helelath]], Kimgrathl grew to understand the large, exciting world that waited beyond the Shalebiter hold. He grew torn between his loyalty to his home and comrades, and his desire to set out to new and exciting challenges to push him to grow. When Orezen&rsquo;s query for the locks of Mihil reached the Shalebiter clan, he knew it was an opportunity to strike out and forge a new home.

The Shalebiter hold had become cramped and saturated, and Kimgrathl was far from the only dwarf looking for opportunities elsewhere. Under his rousing and charismatic leadership, several hundred dwarves left the Shalebiter hold for Mihil. 

#### Area 13.B

[[a|The Mistress's Chambers|Mistress's Chambers]]

> A spacious bedroom with a modest, single-person bed in the corner. The walls of the hall are adorned with dusty, partially-decayed trophies of kills against fearsome beasts. Periodically the ghost of a dwarven woman will appear in the room, busying herself with some minor task in the room before disappearing. 

The ghost woman is [[l|Helelath Shalebiter-Mountainheart|Helelath]], the wife of Kimgrathl. She would spend most of her down time in this chamber, with Kimgrathl spending most of his time in either the [[l|Master Bedroom]], the [[l|Study]], or holding court in the [[l|Throne Room]].

[[a|Trophies on the Wall]]: The trophies on the wall are mostly decayed, many are unrecognizeable. They were a record of heroic feats from the tales of Helelath. Helelath never took trophies from her kills, so these were replicas to show off in the museam. A `DC 21 Perception` check reveals as much. Of those which remain, there are heads of

* A large, reptilian create with a flared, shelf-like face flaring out and dozens of long, fang-like teeth in its mouth. A 'DC 24 Nature' check reveals it is from a Krooth.
* A bull, though the context suggests it probably belonged to a minotaur.
* A huge bird. A `DC 28 Expert Nature` check reveals it is from a Quetzalcoatlus.
* A large insectoid head with faint red-and-blue coloring hidden by the dust. A `DC 25 Trained Nature` check reveals it is from a Remorhaz.

[[a|Helelath Shalebiter-Mountainheart|Helelath]]: Helelath was a fairly plain-looking dwarven woman with ruffled brown hair and freckled, tan skin. She was actually a surface-dwelling dwarf before meeting Kimgrathl and marrying into his clan. She was born and raised on the surface under no clan, and filled her adult life with adventure. She originally met Kimgrathl when she helped him fend off a raiding party of Orcs against the Shalebiter hold. For years, she would periodically visit Kimgrathl with tales of her exploits, even encouraging him to travel with her on more than a few occasions. Eventually, the couple married, though Helelath never settled down in the Shalebiter hold.

Despite her best efforts, did not assimilate well into the Shalebiter society. Many believed it was she who pushed Kimgrathl to leave the Shalebiter hold, and they worried about the hold the mysterious stranger had over their leader. In truth, Kimgrathl's own desire for exploration and adventure was what attracted him to Helelath, and she only provided the emotional support needed to strike out. Still, the Shalebiter-Mountainheart dwarves subtly distanced themselves from Helelath in distrust. Helelath was content in her relative isolation, so spent much of her time either within Kimgrathl's Hall or on the surface.

Spending as much time on the surface as she did, Helelath was an informal dwarven ambassador to the elves. Despite her ostracism, she had a great respect for the Shalebiter-Mountainheart dwarves, and she would often remark about their virtues. The elves understood Helelath's status in the dwarven society, and her opinions bore added weight. As well, Helelath's perspective as an outsider was instrumental in bridging the cultural perspectives between the elves and dwarves.

#### Area 13.C

[[a|The Nursery|Nursery]]

> A small chamber with a little metal crib in one corner. The faint sound of a baby crying can be heard from all around. The spectral form of a baby sometimes appears in the crib. The face appears to be crying, though it seems disconnected from the cries of the room. Additionally, the form of a dwarven woman periodically appears over the crib.

The baby in the crib is [[a|Logreth Mountainheart|Lagretha]], the infant son of Kimgrathl and Helelath. He was almost one year old during the massacre, a miracle child at Helelath and Kimgrathl's age. The woman looking over him is [[l|Helelath]].

#### Area 13.D

[[a|The Study|Study]]

> A chamber slightly divided in two parts. A workbench occupies the western wall, with a modest desk situated to the north, with a few broken chairs arranged before it. The center of the earstern section of the room is occupied by a small scale model of what looks to be the Mountainheart hold, though much smaller and less-developed than the modern day city. The hazy spectral form of Kimgrathl and various other persons manifest around the table, seeming to inspect it.

#### Area 13.E

[[a|Ulgrathem&rsquo;s Room]]

> A chamber filled with broken bookshelves, ripped up books, and slashed furniture. A bed lays in tatters to the western end of the chamber, with long gashes scored into its frame. At the eastern end, a desk has been completely demolished, with parts of it stabbed into the wall. No mist or ghosts appear here. A thin strand of viscous liquid drops into a pool in the center of the room.

[[a|The Corrupted Son]]: The corrupted son takes the form of a giant wolf, with humanoid forearms and a disproportionately small mouth with sharp teeth and two dripping fangs. On the creature's back is the form of Ulgrathem, stitched to the beast with black twine. His head drapes over the face of the creature, replacing its face with his own. It will begin the fight invisible, clinging to the ceiling, waiting for some or all of the party members to enter the room before dropping down and striking. It will be Unnoticed unless a character succeeds on a `DC 30 Perception` check upon entering the room to hear its slightly snarled breathing, at which point it is merely Undetected. On a critical success, it becomes Hidden to the character.

When the monster decides to attack, it will leap at a target. The target then must succeed a `DC 27 Reflex` save or take 2d8+6 slashing damage, be knocked Prone, and be Grabbed by the monster. On a critical success, the target can make a single Strike action against the monster. Then roll initiative. If the creature is noticed before it decides to make this attack, roll initiative then. However, if possible, the monster will try to enter combat with this move.

During the fight with the [[enc|mihil:corrupted_son(1)|5|5]], a character can remove Ulgrathem from the monster by grappling the monster, then using two Interact actions to make a `DC 25 Athletics` check to pull Ulgrathem free. The second check can be made any time after the first, but only by a creature grappling the monster. If the first check is a critical success, it pulls Ulgrathem free immediately.

#### Area 13.F

[[a|Chuthema&rsquo;s Room]]

> A chamber arranged as a modest bedroom. The only noteworthy element in the room is a set of armor arranged along the western wall. It appears to be fitted for a female dwarf, with a mostly-decayed leather under layer adorned with metal plates. The designs and cuts on the plates are a seamless blend of humble, functional, simplistic themes interwoven with more delicate and ornamental decorations.

> The spectral activity in this room is pretty faint, but one scene does seem to pop up, if much less often than scenes in other rooms. This one is of a young dwarven woman fighting with a large warhammer. She seems to be fending off several invisible attackers, and, based on the different snapshots which appears, holder her own for a considerable time before succumbing to several minor wounds administered over the fight.

This room belonged to [[a|Chuthema Mountainheart|Chuthema]], the 16-year-old daughter of Kimgrathl and Helelath. Chuthema was an avid fighter, taking after her parents&rsquo; martial prowess. She took after her father&rsquo;s outgoing and inspiring personality, fitting in and taking charge naturally in any situation. She took after her mother&rsquo;s adventuresome spirit, often exploring new tunnels in the mines and going out on surface patrols to defend Mihil. 

### Area 14

[a|The Courtyard|Courtyard]

> A larged carved cavern, with a natural cavern ceiling above a floor that is a mixture of paved ground and slightly-raised plots of dead soil holding petrified plants. Descending from the ceiling is a thick stalactite with a metallic cage holding a blackened stone that emmanates a faint red light throughout the chamber that contrasts the blue-glowing mists below. Ghosts of commoners and nobles amble about, often examining and inspecting the long-dead foliage of the room.

> On the western wall, a large reinforced door looms. Glowing faintly inches above the door's surface are a pair of large concentric rings of black magical energy. The blue mists seem to pour out from the center of the rings, filling the courtyard and spilling into other rooms.

[[a|The Dead Sunstone]]: The stone above the chamber wass a dwarven sunstone. After centuries, the stone remains viable, though, without heat, the light from the stone is dim and red. A `DC 20 Lore` check reveals the stone's nature. Any hold-based dwarf has a +5 circumstance bonus to the check.

[[a|The Sealed Door]]: Refer to [[l|The Corrupted]] for details on the seal and how it works.

### Area 15

[[a|The Hall of the Dead|Hall of the Dead]]

> A long chamber with several full-bodied depictions of dwarven people carved into the walls leads to a large statue depicting Kimgrathl with a regal elven figure to the right. Both Kimgrathl and the elf wear Nupumab, though the elf's is in a style evocative of his people. Additionally, both wear a crown on their head. The statue of Kimgrathl is holding a shield bearing the Mountainheart crest. Despite the ages, the shield appears sturdy, though there are three inset depressioned carvings in it. The top inset appears to be a rectangular U-shape, one appears in a diagonal shape around the Mountainheart crest in the center, and one appears as a flowing carving around the edge of the shield.

If the party enters the room without removing the seal in [[l|Area 14]], the chamber is still filled with mists, though no ghosts amble about.

This room contains the bodies of those killed in the massacre. Behind each statue is the body of the portrayed person, put to rest. Such internment is a common practice for the honored dead of a dwarven hall, though cremation is the usual method of internment.

[[a|Loot|Hall of Dead Loot]]: The shield in the wall is the <span class="reward">Mountainheart Shield</span>. It is missing three components to enhance its strength. 

[[a|Kimgrathl&rsquo;s Reward]]: If the party managed to free all of the tortured souls, Kimgrathl will reward the party by giving them persmission to take the Mountainheart Shield as well as informing them about his crown inside his tomb, which is a piece of the shield. The <span class="reward">Mountainheart Crown</span> contains a depiction of the Hall of Kimgrathl and the Hall of Orezen facing each other, which can be removed from the crown and placed in the shield. This gives the shield a `+1 circumstance bonus` to saving throws that target the bearer while the shield is raised. Additionally, rescuing all of the victims will give the party <span class="reward">56 XP</span>.

The Mountainheart Shield was created in collaboration between the dwarves and elves, and a symbol of their strength when united. Of the three missing pieces, he knows the crown will improve resistance to spell effects, and that an elven necklace made the shield indestructible, though the latter was stolen away during the massacre. He does not know what the central slot does, as that seems to have been added after his death.

If the party killed all of the ghosts, Kimgrathl will be extremely angry with them and will attack them. The party will have to fight [[enc|mihil:kimgrathl(1)|5|5]]. The party receives no additional XP if they kill Kimgrathl.

### Area 16

[[a|The Elevator|Elevator]]

> A small, dusty chamber filled with crates, barrels, and other storage boxes. Unlike the furniture in the rest of the Hall, these boxes are fully intact and bear the emblem of the Domestic Magisterium. A small platform with gears and chains stands at the eastern end of the room, beside a large lever.

[[a|The Boxes]]: The boxes are storage for the Domestic Magisterium, and they have been down here several years. Nothing of significant value lies within, only linens, building materials, writing supplies, and old records of quota checklists. Some of the barrels are also being used to ferment wine and beer.

[[a|The Platform]]: The platform is an elevator to the Domestic Magisterium undercroft.

# Finishing the Mission

## Planting the Bomb

Using the lever will take the party up to the Domestic Magisterium celler. There, the party can place the bomb and Mulac&rsquo;s brooch.

## Observing the Bomb

Pela will offer the party the opportunity to travel to the surface and, from a safe distance, detonate the bomb remotely when Kobil enters. If the party agrees, later that night they can travel to the surface using a secret tunnel dug out by the Jaguar Slayers to a rooftop near the Domestic Magisterium office. If they wait for Kobil to enter, after a few hours they will see her clearly, walking into the building. At this hour, she is alone and the streets are abandoned.

When the bomb detonates, it create a huge mushroom-shaped plume of fire and smoke the engulfs the center of the building, shattering it outward and into the surrounding buildings. The buildings are far enough that the damage is mostly superficial, but the Domestic Magisterium is completely demolished.

## The Aftermath

The following day, a proclamation for gathering before the Holdkeep will be called in the Undercity, for an announcement from Duke Kawolgh. The gathering is not mandatory, but most of the city will attend, considering it their civic responsibility. Pela will inform the party of the time (midday) and location of this gathering, should the party want to attend. Pela will suggest the party attend, to see whether their plan was a success.

Whether the party attends the gathering or not, they get <span class="reward">84 XP</span> (Moderate Accomplishment) for unseating Mulac once they learn it has been done.

### The Gathering

The area before the holdkeep is a massive street designed for this purpose, so that the Clanchief could make anouncements to the clan as a whole. It is laid out similar to an amphitheater, slanted and with surrounding walls and buildings built to carry the sound from a platform in front of the Holdkeep. Those standing on the platform need to shout to be heard, and there is some noticeable echoing, but overall the construction allows all those huddled before the Holdkeep to clearly hear the announcement. 

The courtyard is not quite large enough to hold the entire population of the Undercity, and as the time of the anouncement approaches / passes the mass will grow and spill out into the Overbridge district, but the party should not have a hard time getting a good view of the Holdkeep or its platform. There they will be able to see a tall figure in fine clothes preparing to speak on the main platform, with some Domestic Magisterium officials, guards, and a dwarven man in chains stand nearby. While the finely-clothed person is likely the Duke, to discern the identities of those on around the platform, a character must make a `DC 20 Perception Check`. On a success, the character is able to conclusively identify the Duke, Kinata Tabel, Guard Captain Huracan, and Mulac (the man in chains), but the Domestic Magisterium officials are all shrouded with black hoods and veils. On a critical success, the character notices the aforementioned details, as well as the fact that one of the Domestic Magisterium officials is a woman bearing the office of High Magistrate, like Kobil, and no magistrates bear the rank of Senior Magistrate.

There, Kawolgh will announce the destruction of the Domestic Magisterium office. He will state that a thorough investigation has managed to swiftly pinpoint the culprit as Mulac. For further elaboration, he turns the announcement over to High Magistrate Kobil Hau, who steps up to the platform and lowers her shroud to reveal her face. She then announces that the Domestic Magisterium office was destroyed by former Clanchief Mulac, who, in addition to abusing his office to enhance his own wealth at the cost of the safety and prosperity of the Mountainheart Clan, had falsified quota records and stolen from the Atzivecan Empire. Kobil anounces that she had recently acquired proof of his crimes, and, in an attempt to assassinate her and destroy the evidence, bombed the Domestic Magisterium.

Kobil announces that, while she was safe from the explosion, Senior Magistrate [[l|Marik Ye|Marik Ye|mihil]] was killed, as well as several Agents and Acolytes, and the Magisterium mourns their losses. After that, Kobil steps down and Kawolgh resumes the platform. He anounces the Mulac Mountainheart has been stripped of his title and office, and will be sent to Zalaz for trial and execution. While he considers who to appoint as Mulac&rsquo;s successor, his Domestic Advisor, Kinata Tabel, will assume the responsibilities of the office until a proper Moutainheart can seat it.

### Learning from Other Sources

After the meeting, the streets of Mihil (both the Undercity and Uppercity) are abuzz about the news. Town criers announce the information, and it is the only thing anyone is talking about. Pela does attend the gathering, so can relay the details to the party if asked. 

### How Did Kobil Live?

Kobil Hau did die in the explosion, but the Senior Magistrate under her, Marik Ye, assumed her identity and office to reduce the perceived success of what he believed the be Mulac&rsquo;s actions. As Mulac was not actually stealing from the Atzivecan Empire, the fact that &ldquo;Kobil&rdquo; thought he was proves that Marik assumed her identity.

Pela, like many in the higher ranks of the Jaguar Slayers, knows that the upper echelon of the Domestic Magisterium is occupied by powerful Voidspawn capable of shapeshifting. She suspected something like this would occur, though she knew it wouldn&rsquo;t matter either way. If the party asks her, she is willing to share what she knows, as she believes the party has proved their loyalty to the organization. She is also aware that these Voidspawn are capable of either creating others, or pull them from the Void, and that they often visit villages which leave the quota system to incentivize them to re-join. It is a large-scale extortion racket that the Domestic Magisterium use to route massive amounts of resources into Zalaz for some project that Atzivec is working on.

## The Route to the Japethan Forge

The modern Phantagorical Cognitum temple, which spans both the Upper- and Undercity, used to be a temple to Nibarell. In the Undercity, a secluded corner of the temple was constructed for rituals to the Japethan Forge. A ritual chamber stood before a long tunnel to the forge, and it was the main tunnel used by the priests. 

When Mihil was conquered, Atzivec collapsed all tunnels to the forge, including the one in the temple, and the ritual chamber was converted into a barely-used storage house for the Phantagorical Cognitum. However, well before the party came to Mihil, Pela worked to dig the tunnel entrance out again, on orders from Exanell. She knows it leads to the Japethan Forge.
