With the location of the Japethan Forge revealed, the party makes their way to the totem of Nibarell. Here, they discover the forge has been overrun by Nyogtha. The abyssal darkness has been contained by two worshippers of Nibarell for decades, but Hrogthl recently killed one in order to let Nyogtha reach out through the Tong's Blood crystals and project its influence.

# The Japethan Forge

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/mihil/japethan_forge_concept.jpg|Approximation of the Japethan Forge|borderless]]

## Rooms

### 1. Entryway|area_1

The entryway to the Japethan Forge is a long tunnel laid out with fine masonry. The tunnel eventually leads to the main cavern of the forge, which is a large chasm spanned by a long bridge (see [[l|Area 2|area_2]]). At the far side of the bridge is the large temple entrance to the Japethan Forge. Large veins of Tong's Blood run from the bridge into the caves connected to the cavern of the forge, burrying themselves in the rock.

An enormous sunstone is nestled below the bridge, and illuminates the ravine 200 ft. below. The ravine is cut by a small stream which is flanked on either side with overgrown fields. Small buildings have been carved into the cliff faces along the field, and, in front of one building, a small patch of the fields has been tamed, tilled, and appears to act as a farm. A tall set of switchback stairs leads down to the bottom of the ravine.

### 2. The Bridge|area_2

The bridge stands 300 ft. by 30 ft. and spans across a large ravine filled with overgrown fields. A large sunstone is nestled under the bridge and bathes the ground below in nourishing sunlight. The bridge itself has Tong's Blood crystal lamps lighting the walkway, though they remain dark.

When the party crosses the ravine on the bridge, they will be attacked by [[enc|core:shadow(4)|5|6]], who will spawn from the Tong&rsquo;s Blood crystals. 

### 3. Main Temple Entrance|area_3

The entrance to the main temple is locked by an enomous mechancial door laden with gears and pistons. It is a self-repairing door, and any damage to a part within it is quickly repaired as the gears and mechanisms engage to fix any damage without letting anything through the door. It is made largely of lead, rendering many spells useless against it.

A large deposit of Tong's Blood crystal is encrusted above the frame of the gate, and veins of the crystal spider-web out to the floor. Before making their way to the bridge, the crystal veins converge on a mosaic in the floor, depicting a hammer and sickle (the symbol of Nibarell the Laborer). The veins converge into a large central stream before breaking apart and flowing down the bridge.

Around this central trunk, the mosaic is damaged, as if having been scored by a large pick, though the vein shows no signs of damage. However, directly below this scar, the dessicated corpse of a monk is sprawled out on the floor, reaching for the cut section of stone.

If the party bangs on the door or makes noise, [[l|Grethlog]] will speak with them through a speaker system installed in the door, which allows communication between the gate outside, the gate inside, and [[l|Area 12|area_12]]. Grethlog is extremely suspicious of anyone trying to enter the temple, and will not let anyone in of his own free will.

[[a|Grethlog Unjok|Grethlog]] (m el.st e): Grethlog is a stone-elven [[l|Zealot of Nibarell|zealot_of_nibarell]]. He, along with his fellow priest, [[a|Hereloth Chenuiz|Hereloth]], were responsible for maintaining the Japethan Forge and keeping Nyogtha enclosed in the chapel. They took up this post approximately twenty years ago, after being called to the Japethan Forge by Nibarell in their dreams, replacing the priests who occupied the roles before them since the fall of the forge. Hereloth was first to arrive, and Grethlog followed a couple of years after him.

A few months ago, Grethlog witnessed a stranger murder Hereloth in the entrance to the temple. The stranger must have been a shapeshifter, as they were disguised as Grethlog at the time to get Hereloth to open the temple. Horrified, Grethlog sealed the temple with himself inside and refuses to let anyone in. Since then, infrequently, though incessantly, shadows have been scratching at the entrance trying to convince Hereloth to let them in. Hereloth is paranoid and will refuse to let anyone into the temple.

The stranger who murdered Hereloth was Hrogthl. After the original monks cut the forge off from the rest of the Tong's Blood network by cutting the vein of crystal off at the trunk, Nyogtha was unable to spread her influence across the caverns. Hrogthl repaired the damaged vein and reconnected Nyogtha to the network.

### 4. The Ravine Farms|area_4

The bottom of the ravine was where the initiates, itinerate monks, and pilgrims would stay. Those in the ravine were expected to abide by Nibarell's tenant of labor, working the fields and smithing and repairing tools. It was here the acolytes learned the fundamental principles of Nibarell the Laborer and hone their skills to impress the senior monks and be seen as worthy of entry into the Forge.

Without the masses usually expected at the forge, most of the fields have become overgrown and wild. Only a small patch, directly in front of the door to [[l|Area 9|area_9]], was tended to by the remaining two priests of the temple after the fall of the forge. With Grethlog sealing himself into the forge, the patch has gorwn somewhat chaotic, but nowhere near as wild as the rest of the ravine.

Carved into the walls of the ravine are many structures which, collectively, form a small villiage. These structures vary in size, from a small single-room hovel to larger, mult-room caverns. While most are on the ground level, a few are a story or two above, with stairs carved up to them. The edifices to these buildings are worn, but show signs of being carved with delicate care. Each structure used Tong's Blood crystal for its lighting, and those crystals remain.

### 5. Lower Workshops|area_5

Many of the structures connected to the ravine of [[l|Area 4|area_4]] are workshops for clothiers, smiths, and wood(shroom)workers. Nibarell craftsmen make their tools to last, so much of the equipment in the worshops is still functional, or would not require much effort to get back into working order. 

Additionally, many plans and schematics are laid out, as well as archived in books on the shelves. Most of these plans and schematics are simple mechanisms designed by apprentices, and are not of significant value. However, taking 30 minutes to Search and trying to `Seek (DC 28)` more sophisticated plans reveals <span class="reward">plans (collectively worth 200gp) for an automatic wheat thresher, a hovering lamp, and an automatic mining drill</span>. The plans would take years for an individual to make, but could be valuable to an industrial mind with more resources.

### 6.Lower Store Rooms|area_6

Connected to the workshops are storage rooms which hold the raw materials used by the craftsmen. This includes simple materials, such as stone, metal ingots, and woodshroom, as well as more expensive materials such as precious metals and gemstones, though the more valuable goods are harder to find.

### 7. Lower Dorms|area_7

Most of the structures connected to the ravine of [[l|Area 4|area_4]] are dorms for the occupants of the lower temple to stay. These are simple one-room cells, basic and inauspicious.

### 8. Lower Mess|area_8

The largest structure attached to the ravine of [[l|Area 4|area_4]] is the communal eating area of the lower temple. Here, the worshippers would meet for their daily meals. The mess is a massive room (60 ft. wide by 70 ft. deep), with a great many tables and chairs, as well as a kitchen, larder, and pantry in the back.

A doorway leads to the granary in [[l|Area 9|area_9]]. 

### 9. Granary|area_9

The granary is the second largest chamber attached to the ravine of [[l|Area 4|area_4]]. It is a long storeroom about 30 ft. wide by 80 ft. deep.

If the party goes inside the granary, they will be attached by [[enc|core:shadow(6)|5|6]], which will appear from the crystals in the ceiling. During their turn in the chamber, as long as they are not in an area of sunlight, a shadow can use an action to retreat into a crystal, disappearing from the field. They can then use an action to return to the fight on their turn.

These shadows will not want to leave the granary, as they want to avoid the sunlight (while the shadow is fighting in sunlight, treat all objects as if they are shedding magical light). For this reason, they will try to stay 20 ft. away from any source of sunlight, including the windows and door. If the party leaves the mess hall into the light of the ravine, the surviving shadows will retreat into the crystals. If the party returns after leaving in such a way, the remaining shadows will return to fight them as long as half survive.

A doorway leads to the mess hall in [[l|Area 8|area_8]]. Additionally, in the back of the chamber is a [[l|broken elevator|broken_elevator]].

[[a|Broken elevator|broken_elevator]]: An elevator used to be used to transport grain from the farms up to the forge's store rooms in [[l|Area 10|area_10]]. However, to seal the forge, Grethlog disabled the elevator. It is currently stuck at the top of the 200 ft. tall shaft. 

This elevator, like most dwarven elevators, works by counterbalancing the rising plate and its expected load with a counterweight. For these devices, a system of chains connects the platform to its counterweight, so that the counterweight falls when the platform rises, and vice-versa. Some form of mechanical input, such as a water or steam turbine, is used to pull or push the platform up or down, with minimal work required when the platform and the counterweight are perflectly balanced.

For this elevator, a spring at the bottom of the shaft is used for mechanical input. The spring is tensioned when the platform is at the bottom of the well, and released when the platform rises. Ordinarily, such a system would be unable to raise a load heavier than a certain limit, and loads lighter than that limit would not reach the ground. However, the spring is a complex mechanism utilizing gold, lead, aluminum, and unakite, allowing the controls to increase / decrease the tension in the spring as needed, allowing the elevator to raise and lower as much weight as needed (within some limits), at a safe rate. 

However, Grethlog sabotaged the system by draining the axiopsychogenic matter from the gold/lead batteries for the spring, resulting in a fixed spring which, fully relaxed, raised the platform to the top of the shaft. Now, the spring mechanism is fixed, and it would require over 1000 lbs of sustained force to lower the elevator to the bottom.

The party can get it working again by restoring the batteries in the spring, a process possible through a copper conduit built into the spring so it could be recharged by the monks. This would require a creature to channel axial matter into the conduit by either expending a level 2 spell slot or touching 20 gold coins to it. The gold coins are drained and disintegrate into lead salt.

A character inspecting the broken elevator could spend 10 minutes to `Recall Knowledge (DC 35)` and determine how the elevator works. On a success, they deduce the mechanism and how to repair it. 

The details for the elevator are located in one of the workshops ([[l|Area 5|area_5]]). The party can Search the workshops, which requires them to `Seek (DC 25)` for the plans for 10 minutes. If the party continues to Search, they must Seek for another 10 minutes, but the DC is reduced by 5. After that, the DC continues to reduce by 5 for each try.

Similarly, after retrieving the plans, some time must be spent studying the schematics and the elevator to determine how to get it working again. A character can spend 10 minutes to `Decipher Writing (DC 20)` using either Craft or an appropriate Lore skill. On a success, the character learns how to repair the elevator. With each attempt to decipher the writing, the DC decreases by 2. Additionally, nothing happens on a failure, and a critical failure only imposes a -2 circumstance penalty to further checks. In any case, the character believes they are making progress with each attempt.

### 10. Upper Store Rooms|area_10

An elevator connects the granary in [[l|Area 9|area_9]] to the forge's several store rooms. These store rooms mainly contained food, drink, and other minor items. Grethlog and Hereloth stockpiled their grain stores here, and Grethlog has been able to survive off the stores for his time in isolation, though many barrels and sacks remain opened and empty. 

Two doors lead from this room. One to [[l|Area 11|area_11]], and one to a hallway connecting to [[l|Area 12|area_12]].

### 11. Upper Mess|area_11

The dining area of the upper temple is smaller and more intimate than the mess hall below, with a small kitchen and a large warm hearth in the room. Additionally, this hall has been well-maintained, though many of the chairs and tables have been moved to the walls of the room, and only a small dining arrangemant is set up in front of the fire. 

### 12. Upper Dorms|area_12

A large, circular chamber forms a common area connecting to a dozen smaller rooms. In the center of the common room is a large stone statue of Nibarell, holding scrolls and writing implements. He faces a large, ornamental door to [[l|Area 13|area_13]]. The walls of the chamber, leading up the talls walls, are covered with tapestries of schematics and designs for a huge variety of mechanical systems. Along one wall is a speaker system similar to that in [[l|Area 3|area_3]].

The smaller, attached rooms are the dorms of the monks. Each room is a spacious living area with a large desk for drafting designs. All but one of the rooms is dark. The lit room belongs to [[l|Grethlog]], who is currently cowering inside afraid of the strangers who made their way up the elevator. Grethlog believes the party is there to kill him, and cannot be convinced by non-magical means otherwise. However, he also wants the shadows to go away, so is willing to talk to them and answer questions as desired. He is not willing to confront Nyogtha or enter the forge.

<b>The Schematics</b>: The schematics on the wall depict ancient systems designed by the monks of Nibarell.

### 13. Chapel / Forge|area_13

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/mihil/nyogtha.jpg|Nyogtha|borderless]]

The center of the Japethan Forge is an enormous molten pool whose fires burn with an intense and magically-suffused energy that, while cool to those in the room, can melt indestructible metals and consume awesome artifacts. The stone from this forge can take on any metallic or gemstone properties required, allowing the creation of magical artifacts of solid stone with whatever properties are desired. 

As well, at the heart of the chamber stands Tong&rsquo;s Heart, an enormous Tong's Blood crystal that stands as the center of the crystal network. It is Nibarell's totem in Zalazich, and the source of the power to the Japethan Forge. 

During Atzivec's rise to power, the Great Old One [[l|Nyogtha|nyogtha]] was installed in the crystal to block out Nibarell. Nyogtha darkened the forge and festered in the heart, and now must be excised to return Nibarell to his throne.

If Nyogtha is reduced to 0 hit points or all of its strands are severed, she dies and is pulled into the Black Codex. This will allow Nibarell to reassume the totem, which will bring light back to the Tong's Blood crystals and restore the forge. Additionally, the sealed passageway to [[l|Area 14|area_14]] opens.

For restoring the totem, the party gains <span class="reward">140 XP</span>.

### 14. Reliquary|area_14

The reliquary contains the <span class="reward">[[l|Japethan Hammer|japethan_hammer]]</span>.
