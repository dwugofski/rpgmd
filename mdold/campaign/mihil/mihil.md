# Overview

## Background

### City History

Mihil was established as a rest stop / trading post connecting eastern Zalazich with the western coast. The Jureth river in the valley and the narrow mountain pass made it an ideal trade route for land travel. Initially, the waterfalls by Mihil down the Jureth river made water trade impossible, limiting its functionality compared to Zutuh and Zucbin, the former of which was the seat of the duchy of Ragpahaxy.

Still, the fertile valley and consistent rainfall made it ideal farmland, so a strong agricultural presence supplemented the trade passage. Additionally, the mines of the Ragpahaxy mountains are rich in precious gems and metal ore, so Mihil gradually became a wealthy city in its own right, eventually surpassing Zutuh in influence. During the Pache Expansionary Wars, Zutuh became such a heavily industrialized powerhouse that the Duke moved his residential palace to Mihil for the better scenery and lower pollution. While the formal seat of power was still in Zutuh for some time, eventually the seat moved to Mihil to match where the Dukes preferred to live.

Sometime during the 8th era, the Duke of Mihil, an elf named [[a|Orezen Chiniluthl]] sought to resolve the issue of the waterfalls which prevented Mihil from being the strongest east/west trade route in Zalazich. Seeing the technological might of the dwarves in their war with them, and wishing to instill good relations as an emergent nation with its power neighbors, the Duke of Mihil, with the permission of the King of Zalazich, requested a clan of dwarves construct a mechanism to help allow boats to travel up and down the river. 

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/mihil/mihil_under_entrance.jpg|The entrance to the main elevator to the under city of Mihil|flavor]]

The Shalebiter Clan were the only ones to respond, and, after extensive negotiations, the dwarves agreed to engineer a solution to the problem. In exchange, they were to be granted permission to establish their own hold underneath Mihil, with exclusive access to the mines thereof and independent trading and governing authority, though Mihil would represent the Mountainheart interests to the rest of Zalazich. With that, a group of Shalebiters left their hold and traveled to Zalazich, establishing the Mountainheart Hold underneath Mihil. 

After a few decades, they constructed the Orezen-Kimgrathl Locks (named after Orezen and [[a|Kimgrathl Shalebiter-Mountainheart]], the leaders who negotiated the deal), a series of locks which were designed to raise and lower boats from the lower river up to Mihil. Like all wonderworks of dwarven engineering, the locks remain today, attended to by the Mountainheart Clan, though many elves of Mihil also know how to work and maintain the locks. They have secured Mihil's place as the prime trading route for caravans wishing to reach the western coast of Zalazich.

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/mihil/mihil_under_city.jpg|The under city of Mihil|flavor]]

The traffic through the locks requires many ships to wait idle on either side before they are allowed to enter the locks, to  prevent overcrowding. This makes it less efficient than land travel, but river travel is safer and more reliable, so it is preferred by wealthier merchants, who can trade in large enough quantities to offset the losses from the wait. Mihil's economy is bolstered by crewmen waiting for their turn to take the locks down. At the low end of the locks, on a rocky and infertile plot of land in the foothills of the mountain, the city of Orezathl (named after the locks) maintains an economy based solely off the supply, entertainment, and hospitality of sailors waiting for their ship's turn at the locks.

While initially recluses under the mountain, the Mountainheart hold gradually integrated itself with the surface city. Their economies grew entwined, similar to, but to a greater extent than the surface villages of the Pache Kingdom. Dwarves still tended to stay underground and elves tended to stay aboveground, but their presence in the respective cities was not uncommon.

Eventually the two cities grew so entwined the separate leadership became unreasonable. This was made worse by the fact that most citizens, even the elves, moved to live underground, with only traders, merchants, and farmers living on the surface, with the former, being wealthy, living in extravagant estates that practically governed themselves. As a result, the baron of Mihil was virtually a redundant position, and the chief of the Mountainheart Clan ruling  over those outside the clan. The elves were not happy to have no influence on the lives of their people, but the dwarves refused to give up their ancestral sovereignty.

As a resolution, the noble elves and dwarves agreed upon a new arrangement. The Earl of Mihil would be joined with the Mountainheart Clanchief. Similar to how they would for a earl, when a Clanchief dies or is removed, the Duke of Ragpahaxy would select a successor. This would ensure that the elven nobility, through the Duke, would have influence over who ruled the city. However, the Clanchief was required to be of noble Mountainheart blood, thus ensuring that the dwarves still governed themselves. The new Clanchief's successor was then appointed as their replacement on the council. This blended the elven and dwarven traditions and was generally accepted by the people, largely because most citizens noticed no impact.

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/mihil/mihil_farms.jpg|The farmland of the under city of Mihil|flavor]]

For the surface, the noble lords, while only barons, would be subject only to the Duke in their own estates, which was a merely formal change by that point, as the Earl of Mihil never exercised much authority over them. The Steward of Chiniluthl Keep would manage affairs between the noble and wealthy families as well as the sparse remaining farmers and residents of the surface. Apart from basic security and maintenance, the surface of Mihil was largely self-sustaining, with nobles mostly keeping to themselves and the citizens usually living far enough apart from each other to be a serious issue, and with enough resources that they had little to complain about.

### Nibarell

According to the Temple of Nibarell, Tong ([[l|Nibarell|title|nibarell]]) was born and raised in Mihil as an orphan. Living on the streets forced him to learn new trades and crafts, which he had a particular gift for. His talent was so impressive he secured a position as apprentice to [[a|Japethen Mountainheart]], the then-Forgemaster of the Mountainheart clan: the first and--so far--only non-dwarf to apprentice a Forgemaster in all of dwarven history.

Despite supposedly being his teacher, Japethen never gave any instruction, encouragement, or notes to Tong, and the apprentice worried he might never please his master enough to earn his blessing as a successor. No matter how hard he tried, Japethen would never give a hint of approval or impression.

There were many in the Mountainheart Clan who felt Tong's appointment was just a stunt to give the only other apprentice, a noble young dwarf woman named Tezea, a token opportunity prove her worth, without the risk of Japethen having to choose someone else. While such duplicity is not the normal dwarven way, when Japethen inspected Tezea's works, he openly praised her improvements and made notes on what to fix to make her crafts better. But, for Tong, he offered nothing but blank recognition of the work. This evident favoritism encourage the theory, and the naysayers made their suspicions well-known.

Feeling inadequate, Tong decided to test Japethen. When Tong and Tezea were meant to present masterwork weapons for Japethen's recognition, he planned to swap his and Tezea's works before the demonstration. Believing Japethen would compliment Tezea no matter what, he built only a simple hoe to compare against Tezea's elaborate greataxe. 

When the comparison day came, Tong went first and pulled off the cover obscuring Tezea's axe between him and Japethen. Tezea was surprised to see her axe before Tong, but, before she could say anything, Japethan exploded on Tong. He knew immediately the axe was not Tong's and that Tong was lying. He pulled off the cover in front of Tezea to reveal the hoe, and sighed in disappointment.

Frustrated with the continuous lack of respect, Tong confronted his master on why he would show such blatant favoritism. After bearing the accusations with no expression, Tong lifted the hoe and brought it to the axe. Wordlessly, he brought the hoe down on the axe, and the axe shattered. Japethen then set the hoe down reverently, nodded to Tong, smiled, and walked away in silence.

At first confused, Tong slowly began to realize what his master had shown him. Japethen never said anything about his works because there was nothing to be said; Tong's works were all perfect. There was only one thing Japethen could teach Tong, and that was to recognize his phenomenal talent and stop wasting it on trying to impress others. It was at that moment that Tong left Mihil to seek out his destiny, which ultimately brought him to the other Sublimes. While Japethen died well before the Sublimes' ascension, Tong convinced Badarell to call his former master from the afterlife to have one final chat, at which Japethen kneeled before Tong and called him, "Master Forgemaster."

When he Ascended, as a gift for his home and his former master, Nibarell created the Japethen Heart, an enormous crystal somewhere underneath Mihil and the Mountainheart Clan. The Japethen Heart would ensure the mines of Mihil would never go dark and never run dry, and Mihil would never go hungry. It created and illuminated veins of ruby--referred to as Jepethen's Blood--in the Mountainheart mines, and would continuously replenish the rock, ore, and gems of the mines over time, like crops regrowing each harvest. 

With the Japethen Heart, the Mountainheart Hold never needed to worry about relocation or expansive mining tunnels, unlike other holds which gradually require satellite settlements for actual mines. The Heart became a prominent place of pilgrimage for priests of Nibarell. Eventually, a large temple in Nibarell's honor was create around the Heart to protect and honor it.

### Under the Atzivecan Empire

While the industrial powerhouse of Zalazich, Mihil, being well-insulated from most threats to the kingdom, was never very well-equipped for defense, and has little in the way of defensive structures. As a result, the city surrendered once Atzivec's armies reached it. Since then, the city's efforts have been kicked into overdrive to produce equipment for Atzivec's armies.

When the soldiers of Atzivec moved to stamp out all worship of the Sublimes in Zalazich, he sent an army to the Japethen Heart. The priests who tended to the Heart collapsed the tunnels leading to it, sealing it away permanently. It was unknown whether any forces had made it to the Heart, or if the temple was safe.

For one week the people of Mihil looked to the Japethen's Blood crystals as a symbol of Nibarell's continued presence with them and hope that the Heart remained. When the Jepethen's Blood crystals went dim after the week, people believed that either the Heart had fallen to soldiers who survived the collapse, or Nibarell had abandoned them. Either way, the city lost faith. While some had hoped it would not be the case, none were surprised when the mines of Mihil stopped regrowing.

The citizens of the city live only to work, and the Empire is not overly concerned with their well-being. Pollution, unsafe working conditions from rapid mining, and over-working lead to a greatly-reduced lifespan for many who live in the city. However, with their wages, a single citizen can often support an entire family from mining and smithing, so it is a sacrifice many are willing to make.

While the surface of Mihil hosts a bustling cityscape for traders and craftsmen, the bulk of the city is hidden below ground. Most of the refining and production takes place in the mines beneath the surface, with most of the trading and display of goods being above. Additionally, most of the residences of Mihil are underground, with only traders, merchants, and surface farmers making homes on the surface. 

In recent months, there have been attacks against various neighborhoods (in the Iron, Copper, and Silver districts) in Mihil. People will return to their houses or visit their friends to discover spatters of blood blanketing the otherwise empty and undisturbed homes. Almost every night, a new neighborhood would be found destroyed, a clear pattern indicating attacks around the outer rim of the city.

With the first attack many assumed Dark Elves or other invaders were launching an attack against the city. Fearful, the citizens abandoned the outer neighborhoods and crammed themselves into the central city. These refugees have overpopulated the districts, and are further taxing the resources and patience of their neighbors.

Several contingents of city soldiers have been sent out to the abandoned districts. Despite all attempts at stealthy scouting, the troops either never return or return with no information. One contingent with Grey Guards were taken, and, while none of the humanoid soldiers returned, the Grey Guard did, spattered in blood but otherwise showing no signs of combat.

## People

### Political Figures

<div class="header">[[a|Duke Kawolgh Balathl|Duke Kawolgh]] (m el.pa a) <br/> 
Title: <em>Duke of Ragpahaxy</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Chiniluthl Keep]]</div>
* A generally average-looking stone elven man whose regal adornments do not seem to fit his approachable countenance. He has medium-length dark hair, braided and swept back with a skirt to it behind his neck. He has blue eyes, which, even taking into account the contrast against his dark skin, seem to peer intensely at whomever he looks at. Still, he wears an effortless smile and his look of bemused interest make you feel like you're meeting an old friend who's about to jump up to greet you.
* Kawolgh is an introspective and contemplative man. He has a shrewd mind for politics, but has used it to benefit his people, rather than make his life easier. He believes strongly in the industrious and disciplined ethos of Mihil, and feels uneasy with leisure or relaxation. He is eager to face complicated challenges, and views complacency and idleness as vices. Perhaps paradoxically, his temperament is subdued for someone so driven to action. He may come off as shy or meek, as he constantly seeks the opinions and insights of others, but in truth he is supremely self-confident and not afraid to assert his authority when he feels action is required.
* Kawolgh understands the problems facing Mihil, but has no authority to do anything about them. His responsibility is to ensure the smooth operation of the entire region, and, while he has a special interest in his home city, he must trust Mulac (appointed by his father) to do the best he can, despite the increasingly-obvious signs of corruption.

<div class="header">[[a|Regional Supervisory Magistrate Kobil Hau|Kobil]] (f el.st ma [Dendrite]) <br/> 
Title: <em>High Magistrate</em> (Domestic Magisterium)<br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Domestic Magisterium]] (living quarters), [[l|Chiniluthl Keep]] (work)</div>
* A woman with skin so fine it seems to glow, shimmering black hair woven that cascades down her back and shoulders in a mix of loose tassels and tight braids, adorned with striated jasper stones. She wears the robes of a high-ranking magistrate, and they are tailored to complement her handsome form. Her eyebrows are slightly peaked, and her mouth gently raised in a smirk, both giving the impression of curious eagerness. However behind her eyes you cannot shake the feeling of something predatory. You feel like a mouse being watched by a cat before it gets bored with the show and decides to pounce.
* Outwardly, Kobil is open, confident, and self-deprecating. She has earned herself a reputation as the most amiable magistrate in the Domestic Magisterium. She is polite and patient with others, and, unlike many other magistrates not only permits but even participates in casual conversation and small talk, rather than being all business. Still, like any magistrate she is not in her position to make friends, so, as pleasant as she is to get along with, she is a closed book emotionally.
* Mihil, and Ragpahaxy in general, is firmly under the hand of the Atzivecan Empire. The industrial powerhouses of Mihil, Zucbin, and Zutuh are far too important to the war effort for the Magisterium to permit otherwise. As a result, Kobil is somewhat bored and tired of her post. It has earned her great esteem in the Empire, but she has almost made herself redundant. As a result, she has had to amuse herself by playing with the politics and intrigue of her region. She spreads rumors and incites minor squabbles between lesser nobles and wealthy merchants. Nothing to distract from her mission, but enough to see people squirm, fret in their sleep, and maybe kill each other in small skirmishes.
* She is well aware of the political situation in Mihil. She knows Mulac is corrupt--she's even taken advantage on that corruption on more than one occasion for her games--but he knows well enough not to challenge the Empire, so he will continue to be a good pawn as long as he is in power. With this in mind, she has repeatedly moved against his political enemies, using her political acumen and capital to silence council grumblings from reaching Duke Kawolgh. This has perplexed those keen enough to notice her hand in these matters. There are rumors she is having an affair with the married Mulac: a rumor which seems to neither scandalize nor insult her. If anything, it appears to amuse her. So she permits its persistence.

<div class="header">[[a|Domestic Advisor Kinata Tabel|Kinata]] (f el.st a) <br/> 
Title: <em>Domestic Advisor</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Kinata Estate]] (living quaters), [[l|Chiniluthl Keep]] (work)</div>
* Dressed in a conservative and professional, though still distinctly fashionable, dress bearing the hallmarks of a Mihil city official, she keeps her dark hair medium length, with a sweep usually tucked behind her ear which occasionally falls and lightly obscures the right side of her face before she pulls it back and secures it behind her ear again. She stands tall and confident, making it clear she belongs wherever she stands. Her presence is imposing, but welcoming, rather than intimidating.
* Kinata is an ambitious advisor to the Duke, and her honesty, intelligence, and earnest geniality have earned dear respect from the ruler. Much like the Duke, Kinata is a devoted civil servant and wishes to use her power to better the region, even if it makes it harder for her to retain her position and the nobility afforded to it. She believes strongly in the value of hard work and determination, and, while she is compassionate to those less fortunate, has a low opinion of those who would rather complain than do anything to improve their situation. She is not a cold or unfriendly person, but her austerity and discipline make humor and fun strange concepts to her. She would much rather spend her time working than in leisure.
* Kinata was born and raised on the surface of Mihil. Her parents, farmers, were executed as Nibarell worshippers during Atzivec's rise; they refused to renounce their faith. After witnessing their death, not wanting her younger sister, Icthalca--a toddler at the time--to grow up without family, Kinata renounced the faith. Unfortunately, the Phantagorical Cognitum did not believe Kinata, and so took Icthalca so Kinata would not raise her in heresy. The Cognitum kept an eye on Kinata, but she was more devoted to finding her lost sister than to her parents' god. They eventually stopped keeping tabs. As Kinata worked her way into the political circles of Mihil, she eventually managed to reconnect with her sister, who, having left the Cognitum, was working three jobs in Ochib to make ends meet.
* Kinata's chief responsibility is to manage and report on the earls of Ragpahaxy. She keeps track of political issues within the various earldoms, tracks quota progress and projections, addresses minor disputes between the earls, and resolves simple requests such as resource allocations and guard assignments. When an issue requires the Duke's attention, she informs the Duke and provides her opinion on the matter. 

<div class="header">[[a|Clanchief Mulac Mountainheart|Mulac]] (m dw. e)<br/>
Title: <em>Clanchief</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Mountainheart Holdkeep]]</div>
* Somewhat thin and lean for a dwarf, the elderly Mulac's scraggly grey hair, wispy white bard, and gaunt, bespectacled face look like that of a frail old man. His eyes are sharp, however, and his face is twisted into an intense wincing growl of perpetual determination and defiance. 
* Mulac is not a pleasant man. He can be charming--albeit proud--when he thinks someone has something he wants, but he's dismissive and rude for those he considers of no value. He is singularly focused on the wealth of his immediate family and legacy, and will do whatever he needs to get what he wants. He has no real qualms about morality, but he does understand that he must operate within the laws and expectations around him to get what he wants, so he plays the game and puts on the appearance of moral consideration when he needs to.
* Mulac is an ambitious schemer who spent his whole life working to get to his position as Clanchief. His ultimate goal in life has been to establish a safe legacy for his children, despite the dark times in Mihil. He has made backroom deals with crooks, nobles, magistrates, and priests to funnel as much wealth as he reasonably could into his pocket without drawing suspicion. He tries to carefully balance the interests of the council, the suspicions of the Duke, and the duty and authority of his position against his secretly-amassing wealth.
* While it is difficult to argue that Mihil would be prosperous would it not be for Mulac, the Clanchief's selfishness and corruption have certainly not helped alleviate the city's problems.

<div class="header">[[a|Tepeuli Mountainheart|Tepeuli]] (f dw a)<br/>
Title: <em>Councilman</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Tepeuli Estate]]</div>
* Tepeuli is short by dwarf standards, with squished facial features and short blonde hair cut in a high-and-tight. Despite her short stature, her heavily-muscled frame, reset nose, and lightly scarred face shows she's no one to be messed with. Still, her worn face is settles in a relaxed but amused, with her seemingly default expression leaving her left eyebrow slightly raised and her lips almost imperceptibly pulled back in an ephemeral but unmistakable hint of a smirk.
* Tepeuli is a playful, extroverted, and energetic dwarf. While a wealthy noble by birth, she was never too pleased with a life sitting back letting people tend to her every needs. She preferred to play in the dirt and mud, wrestling with the other kids and learning how to swing a pickaxe. Frequent encounters with hostile cave creatures while exploring dried-up, abandoned mines as a kid left their mark on her face, but she managed to hold her own as a kid, and never let her fear stop her from having fun. As a child, her mother feared she would never accept the responsibility of leadership as a clan noble, but when her father died and her mother was stricken with grief, Tepeuli stood up and bore the tedious responsibilities of a council member to spare her mother the stress. While she has a reckless, adventurous, and energetic spirit, she deeply cares for others, and knows how and when to quell her anxious instincts and be patient. She manages to be a shrew politician without betraying her quintessentially dwarven spirit.
* Tepeuli believes&mdash;rightly so&mdash;that Mulac is corrupt, and she has made her opinion well-known. Her down-to-earth attitude, extroverted energy, and generous spirit have earned her the respect and admiration of many dwarves, and all but those in bed with Mulac would prefer to see her as Clanchief instead, though the laws and traditions must be respected, and Tepeuli would suggest no different, as much as she dislikes Mulac.
* On the subject of the Empire, Tepeuli recognizes their sovereignty and believes Mihil in general should. She sees the issues of Mihil as less a result of their involvement--the quota, while dire and taxing, is not something they are incapable of meeting, and more a result of Mulac's corruption. While she understands the pull that the vision of an effortlessly prosperous and happy Mihil is alluring, she believes the path to achieving it lies in moving forward with the Empire, not against them. 

<div class="header">[[a|Kiso Mountainheart|Kiso]] (m dw a)<br/>
Title: <em>Councilman</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Kiso Estate]]</div>
* Kiso is an average-sized dwarf, with frame built from long hours farming and mining. He has long black hair, shaved on the sides and braided over the top and down his back, almost to the floor, with a well-trimmed, though fashionably perturbed moustacheless beard that narrows to a point at the center of his chest. His eyebrows are knotted in a consternated scowl, and his mouth, which, while already unusually small, is dwarfed by his large nose, rests in a frown. Despite what one might expect from his expression, he manages to look contemplative, not angry.
His smile somehow shows in his eyes, despite his eyebrows remaining scrunched and his mouth only barely curving at the sides.
* Kiso is a smart, principled, and honest dwarf. He has a reputation for a keen mind and a sharp wit, and his biting quips are legendary for being scathing to endure, but hilarious to witness. Indeed, while he is opinionated and not afraid to speak his mind or ridicule those who need humbling, Kiso rarely insults or derides others in mean spirit. He usually teases and mocks in good fun, and is quick to diffuse tensions when tempers start getting involved. Kiso is devoted to the people of Mihil, and, despite his inherited wealth, spends most of his time not with the council working the mines or fields, as he believes in honest work and understanding the needs to the people from their view. He also enjoys spending nights carousing in taverns, connecting with old friends and sharing boastful tales and load songs. At his heart, Kiso believes in unity, and believes that, united, the people of Mihil can achieve anything.
* Kiso believes Mulac is killing Mihil, and has made his opinion well-known. His cunning and ability to cut through tensions and cut to common ground to resolve disputes has earned him recognition as a valuable figure in the city's government, so much so that, apart from those in bed with Mulac, the council would rather he be Clanchief. Still, Kiso does not want to undermine the strength of the city by inciting a civil war, so he refuses to encourage moves against Mulac.
* On the subject of the Empire, Kiso believes Mihil would be better off without them. He dreams of a Mihil like the tales of old, prosperous and glorious, not frightened and desperate. He is sympathetic towards the Jaguar Slayers, and they count him among them. While he would not jeopardize his people, he would be inclined to support the Jaguar Slayers should a feasible rebellion begin

### Organizations

#### Jaguar Slayers

Mihil is a location of intense interest for the Jaguar Slayers. However, it is also a place of significant interest for the Atzivecan Empire. As a result, the Jaguar Slayers' activity in the city must remain clandestine. This is difficult, however, as dwarves are not known for being subtle or deceptive. Thus the Jaguar Slayers have been slow and deliberate to recruit clan members to their ranks. 

<div class="header">[[a|Bitol Mountainheart|Bitol]] (m dw ma):<br/>
Title: <em>Coordinator</em> (Mountainheart Hold)<br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|The Bloody Tong Inn]]</div>
* A simply-dressed dwarf with leathery, wrinkled skin and short red hair. He has a stern expression on his face and is smoking a long pipe that he keeps passing from one side of his mouth to the other. Like most Jaguar Slayer coordinators, he's an advocate for the community and a down-to-earth everyman. Unlike most, he's relatively new to the position, and is nervous about what he may have gotten himself and his city into.

<div class="header">[[a|Zacol Tlacolotl|Zacol]] (m el.pa a):<br/>
Title: <em>Coordinator</em> (Mihil Surface)<br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|The Bloody Tong Inn]]</div>
* A scrawny elven man with long black hair dressed in the clean, though slightly worn, clothes of a Zalazichan peasant. Like Bitol Zacol gained his position only recently, and shares his partner's concerns with what they are doing. However, he trusts Pela and is able to keep Bitol on-board.

<div class="header">[[a|Pela Trizal|Pela]] (m el.pa a):<br/>
Title: <em>Espionage Specialist</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|The Bloody Tong Inn]]</div>
* Her disguise (alias: **Neheloth Den**) is of a muscular stone elven woman wearing a dusty apron and forge-worker's outfit, her short black hair held back with a light blue bandanna. Her actual form is that of a fair sky-elven woman with short white hair pulled into a bun atop her head, wearing a plain beige tunic and tan skirt.
* Pela is dedicated to the Jaguar Slayer cause, as are all the able priests and priestesses of [[l|Exanell|title|exanell]]. She believes in the party, but is still cautious about their motives and possible connection to Hrogthl. She holds her mission above all other goals and will do anything to see it through to completion. Her loyalty to Avagar is second only to her faith in Exanell.

#### City Guard

<div class="header">[[a|Huracan Mountainheart|Huracan]] (m dw ma):<br/>
Title: <em>Captain of the Guard</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Mountainheart Holdkeep]]</div>
* A dwarf man in the pristine raiment of the Mihil guard, with a well-oiled manicured brown moustache and beard, and a head of short brown hair parted to the right to cover a bald stripe from a scar that runs from the top of his right eye to the back of his head. His bearing is stoic, rigid, and commanding, and as he turns to regard you, you can't help but feel his intense glare taking you in and sizing you up with the practiced efficiency of a disciplined soldier.
* Huracan is paranoid about the problems of the outer neighborhoods. Knowing an oppressive, murderous, powerful, and imminent threat lingers beyond the city walls would be stressful enough for a city guard. But, stressed out working hard to keep order in the refugee areas of the city, and without any understanding of what that lurking threat is, Huracan's mind has been spinning out of control. He treats everyone with suspicion, and is on the verge of breaking down, though his training keeps him outwardly composed.

[[a|Marik Ye|Marik]] (m el.st a [Dendrite]):  
Title: *Senior Magistrate* (Domestic Magisterium)

* A spindly stone-elven man with a narrow face and elongated nose. Kobil delights in his role as a bureaucrat, frustrating wealthy and powerful nobles and merchants as they try to document their quotas and wait helplessly for approval on shipping manifests and docking permits. Their misery is ecstasy to him.

#### Keyshakers

Even dwarven holds are not immune to the influence of the Keyshakers, who typically gain recruits from the cynicism and disillusionment of the various clan members whom the family would prefer to ignore, rather than face the guilt of not wanting to help their brothers and sisters. Mihil is far from an exception, especially under Atzivec, garnering recruits from the cosmopolitan people of the city who were left to be ground into the dust by the Industrial Machine that the Empire has turned Mihil into.

**Location**: Basement of the [[l|The Pick and Hammer]]

[[a|Kuda Della|Kuda]] (**Amaera Kucheln**) (f ho ma)  
Title: *Boss* (Mover)

* Kuda is a half orc woman with and long flowing black hair, tied into braids with an arrangement of silver and gold threads. She is dressed in some light leather wrappings over a commoner's outfit, but the studding on the leather is intricately detailed, and the commoners' clothes are immaculately clean and trimmed with detailed, decorative patterns which suggest greater wealth than the class she's dressed as.
* Kuda is a self-assured crime boss. Like many of the Keyshakers, she comes form humble origins, having been abandoned by her mother at an orphanage when born, but she feels that she's proved herself and no longer needs to get her hands dirty. While she is not afraid to get her hands dirty if needed, she will not take kindly to anyone who forces her to do something she thinks is below her station. While her hierarchical view of duty may come off as snobbish, she respects the work of her underlings and views the privileges of rank as something a person earns through hard work, as well as something that can be taken away if a person is undeserving of their position.
* As the boss of one of the wealthiest cities in Zalazich, Kuda is extremely wealthy, a fact she regularly and deliberately undersells. Her alter-ego, Amaera Kucheln, is a noble woman in the upper city, having secured her position despite her non-elven status due to shrewd investments based on her underworld knowledge. It is a common rumor in the noble circles that Amaera is connected with Kuda, but if anyone suspects that Amaera is actually Kuda, none have said so. Most seem to believe they are relatives, possibly sisters.

[[a|Chyles Mountainheart|Chyles]] (m dw ma)  
Title: *First Lieutenant* (Shaker)

* A short slender man with copper hair that hangs longer in the front than the back, obscuring his face with bangs most of the time. He's dressed in a simple green tunic and trousers, with multicolored dust, possibly colored chalk, on the fringes of his tunic as well as his undershirt's sleeves.
* Chyles is a conniving, scheming lackey who rose in the ranks of the Keyshakers despite not being committed to the virtues of the organization. He is a spy for the Coalmongers, who are paying him to reveal secrets about the Keyshakers. Kuda knows this and is using him to manipulate the Coalmongers and secure order in the district.

[[a|Uxtreda Mountainheart]] (f dw ya)  
Title: *Second Lieutenant* (Shaker)

* A stout young woman with white hair tied into two buns and pigtails on either side of her head, she is dressed in a clean and prim commoner's outfit.
* Uxtreda grew up as an orphan in the under city, much like many of the Keyshakers in Mihil. However, her work ethic made her stand out to Kuda, who saw a lot of herself in Uxtreda. Kuda is grooming Uxtreda as her replacement when she decides to retire, but keeps her as a second lieutenant until Chyles has outlived his usefulness.

#### Coalmongers

Typically crime is not a serious issue for dwarven clanholds, as their sense of family fosters a community without the need for taking from others. However, with the involvement of the elves and the crushing influence of the Empire, the Mountainheart clan has more illicit elements and unlawful influences than your typical isolationist hold. This has turned many a dwarf against their family.

The Coalmongers are gang of bloodthirsty thugs lead by a stone elf man named Ugroth. He has a reputation for scooping up kids and gradually leading them to a life of crime. He gets them to hurt his family members and cut off all ties with them. Then he grooms them to become his gang members. To underscore this element of "family", he has all his gang members take on the surname of "Coalmonger," which, for dwarves, replaces their connection to the Mountainheart clan.

The Coalmongers relish violence and crime. Ugroth has fostered in them a shadow of his own bloodlust, and they enjoy hurting others. They are widely feared, but operate in the Gold District, where only corrupt guards patrol without losing their lives.

**Location**: [[l|Gold District]]

* The Coalmonger's headquarters is an old butcher's warehouse. The main floor still has the various meat hooks, and it's a well-circulated rumor around the Gold District that sometimes an unfortunate victim of Ugroth's bloodlust will be hoisted on one of those hooks as the center of entertainment for a Coalmonger party.

[[a|Ugroth Coalmonger|Ugroth]] (m el.st ma)  
Title: *Boss*

* A tall, wiry man with angular features and long flowing back hair that goes down to his waist. His face is covered in thin scars, slashing about his face, symmetric on either side.
* Ugroth is a cruel man who delights in the pain of others. He masks this well, though, taking an interest in all of the Coalmonger recruits and convincing them he's there to help them. Starting with innocuous slights, he escalates his demands so slowly that, before they notice it, the recruit has isolated themselves from all those they love. Then, Ugroth becomes the only "family" they have.
* This sadism has hampered the effectiveness of the Coalmongers. It has given them a bloodthirsty reputation which has significantly cut down on the number of people willing to work with them.
* His behavior is erratic and unpredictable, which is why Kuda is determined to get rid of him.

[[a|Neckem Coalmonger|Neckam]] (m dw e)  
Title: *First Lieutenant*

* A scruffy-looking black-haired dwarf, aged by a look of haunted regret, in a thug's leathers and a small, partially crushed pewter pendant of a bird in his beard.
* The oldest dwarf in Ugroth's gang, having joined over 40 years ago, Neckem knows the psychopath's game. As a child, he was infatuated with Ugroth's promises and deception. It lead him to betray his family at a young age, stealing all their savings and giving it to Ugroth. He was not surprised when his parents refused to speak to him, but his younger brother Trelam kept trying to reach out to him despite everyone else expressly hating Neckem. Neckem read the letters, but never replied. They never stopped.
* Eventually, since his parents had no savings to rest on when they got too old to work, Trelam had to would extra shifts in the mine, regularly working 72 hour shifts with only 8 hours of sleep between. It was unsustainable, and his heart started to give out at the age of 35. When Neckem heard of his brother's illness, he snuck in to visit him in what would be his deathbed. While his parents were long dead, Trelam's wife forbid him from visiting. There, Trelam gave Neckem a bird pendant that Neckam had given him as a childhood gift. Neckem visited him secretly the following two nights, after which Trelam died.
* The next time he killed, Neckem thought of Trelam dying. He swore on his brother's pendant he would never kill again, and, using his position and age as an excuse, had managed to stay true to that for the past 8 years. When he sees the others' bloodlust, he only feel disgust.
* When Ugroth found out what the pendant meant (though not the vow), he crushed it, but Neckem did his best to repair it and now wears it openly as a small sign of rebellion against Ugroth.
* Neckem is secretly a spy for the Keyshakers, in return for the Keyshakers taking care of Trelam's family.
	* Ultimately, Kuda does not want to be rid of the Coalmongers, but she greatly detests Ugroth. But Ugroth's hold on his underlings is too strong for him to be replaced without assassination (against the Keyshaker way) or serious repercussions. 
	* She is trying to undermine Ugroth and establish [[l|Ikahna]] as the leader

[[a|Ikahna Coalmonger|Ikahna]] (f dw a)  
Title: *Enforcer*

* A muscular dwarven woman with short cropped hair and an ugly scar that runs along the left side of her face. She dressed in reinforced leather armor and carries a big dwarven waraxe.
* Ikahna was an easy convert for Ugroth. She views attachment and morality as weaknesses. This is in large part due to her experience with her older brother, who took control of the household when their parents died while she was little and he was just old enough to be trusted with such things. He was not good as a parent, and abused her when she was growing up, believing (ultimately correctly) it would make her strong. She had no trouble killing him and getting away with it when Ugroth demanded it.
* She is more of your traditional thug crime boss. She gets the job done and sees to it everyone gets their fair take. She doesn't care much about the job, as long as it pays well and is something she can do. Unlike Ugroth, she does not have a bloodlust. She tries to suppress all emotion, so would not feel joy either way, but every time she kills someone she has a disorienting episode where she associates her victim with her younger self and feels like she's her brother. But, in the spirit of camaraderie, she participates in the feasts and celebrations.
* While she would never admit to it, she has fallen for Ugroth's charms. She is loyal and attached to him, even if she hates that about herself. She is, in a way, in love with him. 
	* While being and elf and thus much older, Ugroth does present as being the age her brother would be had she not had killed him.
* Despite being younger and lower-ranked than Ugroth, she views Neckem as the mature father figure of the gang. She knows he cares about her and the other Coalmongers. Even though she mocks him for it, she does respect what he does to keep everyone together. She values his advice, even though she pretends not to.
	* Neckem is the only one she's told about her episodes. In return, he told her about his brother. This has sown some seeds of doubt against Ugroth.
	* One of the key ways Kuda uses Neckem is to encourage confidence in Ikahna. Kuda wants Ikahna to believe she can run the Coalmongers better than Ugroth

## Locations

### City Map

Mihil is divided into two levels: the above-ground, predominantly elven Uppercity, and the underground, predominantly dwarven Undercity.

#### Uppercity

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/mihil/mihil_over_map.png|Mihil Uppercity]]

The Mihil Uppercity is nestled in a valley between two mountains. A river flows between the length of the valley, with dozens of shipping freights dotting the northern side. An imposing fortress towers above the city, firmly in the heart of the larger, western side of the of the valley. Surrounding the fortress, spread about the town, there are clusters of large buildings: big estates with lush gardens and extravagant architecture.

On the western shore of the river, dense docks with shanty buildings and large warehouses stand in stark contrast to those lavish estates. Further off the shore there are more respectable buildings, but they are only small houses and living quarters. On the opposite shore, sliding up the mountainside, you see terraces of villas and pretty estates.

#### Undercity

### Buildings and Services

[[a|The Bloody Tong Inn]] (Inn; Comfortable)  
**Location**: [[l|Underbridge District]]  
**People**:

* [[a|Batzun Mountainheart|Batzun]] (m dw ma): *Proprietor*
	* A dwarven man with a mane of prematurely-greyed hair. It's clear the inn keeps him too busy to properly groom his himself, as his long hair is swept back out of his face and held back with a hastily-tied knot, while his bushy beard is matted in some places, with some tongues sticking out in random directions. He's tired and somewhat out of it, but alert enough to be properly hospitable to his guests and patrons, if a bit dopey in his demeanor.
* [[a|Xulxe Cheth|Xulxe]] (f hu.zalaz a): *Bouncer*
	* Wearing branded mail and standing guard with a battle axe at her side, she scans the room with a disinterested, distant look in her green eyes. While a bouncer for the establishment, she is friendly with the patrons when they come up to her, as it's the only real break she gets from the tedium of sitting guard half the day.

[[a|The Pick and Hammer]] (Tavern)  
**Location**: [[l|Underbridge District]]  
**Description**: The sign above this tavern depicts a pickaxe and hammer behind a frothy tankard. While still fully intact, this building has seen better days. The frame of one of the windows is partially popped out, with the stone sagging behind it. From base to roof, the stone face is etched with a variety of symbols, names, words, and sentences, with many of the rude ones scored in a futile attempt to prevent legibility. No noise comes from inside, and the people around it move to give the entrance a wide berth.  
**People**:

* [[a|Cilane Jelilal|Cilane]] (m el.sk e): *Proprietor*
	* An elderly sky elven man with frazzled white hair haphazardly brushed back and tied in a knot on the verge of coming undone. He is missing his left arm, which is capped by a bronze cuff inlaid with unkanite stones. He is cleaning a mug with the cloth held in his right hand and the mug being held in air, suspended with no clear force.
	* Cilane was a mage who resisted Atzivec's rise and his arm was cut off to prevent him from being effective at being a mage. Using his knowledge, he designed the cuff to help him interact telepathically with things as if he still had his left arm. He requisitioned the part from the Dwarves of Mihil. Unable to pursue his life as a mage, he used his funds to establish a tavern. Unfortunately, he lacks decent social skills and as such is not a favorite stop for most. However, due to this reputation, criminals like to frequent his tavern for its relative privacy
