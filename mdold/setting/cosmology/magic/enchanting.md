[[title|Enchanting|0]]

Enchanting is, formally, the process of manipulating and/or combining an existing class-2 axial construct with one or more class-2 and/or class-1 constructs in order to create a new class-2 axial construct with the ability to manipulate the flow of raw axiopsychogenic matter for some designed end. Informally, it is the process of bestowing magical properties onto an object.

# Fundamentals of Enchanting

In general, the purpose of an enchantment is to create an item which allows a person to manipulate axial matter in a way they normally cannot. An enchanted item may allow a person to gather axial matter more efficiently or to a greater extent than they normally can. Or an enchanted item may allow the person to channel axiopsychogenic matter through an ethereophysical shell much more complex than he or she could normally. Or an enchanted item may allow a simple magical effect to persist without a magic user having to manually pump the effect with axiopsychogenic matter.

In all these cases, and many more, the core purpose of an enchantment is to provide some capability the person is unable to achieve themselves. Therefore, only a class-2 axial construct would suffice for such an end, since class-1 constructs would not last long enough to be used, and class-3/4 constructs would be suceptible to internal mutations which could change the capabilities of the item. 

It is important to note that some enchantments walk a fine line between being a class-1 and class-2 axial construct:

* **Fragile Enchantments**: Some enchantments fade or break over time if not regularly infused with axial matter, similar to class-1 constructs. However, provided they do not instantly collapse as soon as they exhaust their well of axial matter, they are still technically class-2 constructs, they simply can be worn down by the external forces of time.
* **Finite Enchantments**: Some enchantments have a finite pool of axial matter, and, after a certain number of uses, become inert. For these enchantments, while the exhaustion of axial matter means the enchantment is no longer functional, the construct remains, however impotent, like a quiver without arrows.
* **Demi Enchantments**: Some enchantments&mdash;especially those involving[[l|mercury|Mercury]]&mdash;will have some of their ethereophysical shell collapse immediately without axiopsychogenic matter, but the enchantment as a whole is able to gather enough axial matter to maintain the shell. Not all agree these types of constructs qualify as enchantments, and do not believe the definition of enchantments should permit partial class-1 construction. However, as it aligns with the general function of an enchantment&mdash;a thing which allows the manipulation of raw axiopsychogenic matter outside the user&rsquo;s normal operation without the need for them to pump the construct with axiopsychogenic matter for it to persist&mdash;they are generally accepted as enchantments.

For the purposes of analysis, the process of crafting an enchantment can often broken down into three key components: the material shell, the programming, and the power supply.

## The Material Shell

The material shell for an enchantment describes the raw physical presence of the item. Typically, the materials used in crafting are made from raw materials gathered from Makafell (or, in the case of exceptionally exotic crafts, other planes). While an enchanted item can be constructed purely from magic, composing the ethereophysical shell from scratch and strengthening the item to make it persistent is inherently significantly more complicated than crafting the original class-1 construct, which often would defeat the purpose, and the axial matter required for such an approach is often prohibitively expensive. It is rarely cheaper to craft an enchantment using magic than using materials&mdash;neither in terms of monetary cost nor axial matter, and then only for the most elite magical masters.

Much like how an ethereophysical shell&rsquo;s function depends on both its shape and its lattice, the capabilities of an enchantment are determined by both the shape of the construction as well as the material properties of the components which go into the item. Most often, enchanted items are made of [[l|metal|Metals]] and [[l|gems|Gems]], as, among class-2 construct materials, their ethereophysical lattices are often consistent, difficult to change with outside force, and capable of channeling axiopsychogenic matter in interesting ways. However, many materials&mdash;especially those related to, produced by, or developed near strong axial constructs&mdash;are similarly robust and interesting, but they are also often substantially more rare.

The material shell is the only essential component of all enchantments. Some enchantments are impossible to make without programming and/or a power supply, but no enchantment can be made without a material shell, if simply due to the fact that, as a class-2 construct, an enchantment must have a physical presence, and, therefore, must have a material shell. While this may seem obvious, some use the term &ldquo;enchantment&rdquo; to refer to a construct which maintains persistence only as long as they are regularly pumped with axiopsychogenic matter. Because they will collapse without this pumping, these constructs have no class-2 permanence (material shell), and are thus not truly enchantments by the formal definition.

## The Programming | Programming

For simple enchantments, the material shell is sufficient to achieve the desired effect. The unguided interactions of its constituent ethereophysical shells can be sufficient. However, complicated enchantments require precisely controlled interactions, and it is often extremely difficult to shape a material shell with that level of precision. The process of fine-tuning the axial matter interactions in an enchantment is programming.

In order to program an enchantment, some programming medium is required. A programming medium is some material capable of having its ethereophysical lattice slightly altered while still maintaining most of its physical properties. Secondary materials from class-3/4 entities, such as wood, leather, and fur, work well for this, though steps need to be taken to ensure the materials do not decompose over the lifetime of the item. Amorphous and graphite carbon also works well for programming, which enables steel to take programming, but diamond carbon does not, as its ethereophysical lattice is not easily mutable. However, both amorphous and diamond silicon work well for programming.

Programming is the main &ldquo;magical&rdquo; component of enchanting, as it does involve recomposing the programming medium&rsquo;s ethereophysical lattice. However, unlike spellcasting, programming does not require significant quantities of axial matter, so it is possible for someone without any other magical abilities to program an enchantment with only some well-constructed enchanted tools and sufficient [[l|gold|Gold]].

### Attuning and Activating an Enchantment

In order to use a programmed enchantment, it is sometimes necessary to connect and interact with the enchantement in a specific way.

Some programmed enchantments provide an interface to a user&rsquo;s soul, and the user must adjust their soul to connect with that interface to use the enchantment. The process of adjusting one&rsquo;s self to the interface of an enchantment is [[a|attunement]]. Not all enchantements can be attuned by all people. Some enchantements require one&rsquo;s soul to be constructed in particular way. For example, only those with a close connection and understanding of nature may use one enchantment, while only evil people could use another. Some enchantments are even keyed to an individual&rsquo;s soul so only they may use it, though such enchantments are rare as they can often by bypassed by anyone sufficiently motivated.

While even non-programmed enchantments may still need some phsyical action (e.g. pressing a trigger) to activate them, programmed enchantments can vary in their activation methods. Some may require a particular command word be spoken. Some may require that the user channel some axial matter into the enchantment in a particular way. Some may only require an intention or desire. 

## The Power Supply

While enchantments&mdash;by definition&mdash;do not require one to supply a constant stream of axial matter to maintain persistence, all enchantments&mdash;again, by definition&mdash;require raw axiopsychogenic matter in order to function. Some enchantments require an external supply of axiopsychogenic matter, which means they can only be used by axial channelers, which generally means spellcasters. However, when the effect of the enchantment is meant to be more powerful than the provided power, or when it is meant to be used by someone who cannot channel axial matter, there must be some other supply of raw axiopsychogenic matter.

The most common power supply for an enchantment is [[l|gold|Gold]], since it can hold raw axiopsychogenic matter. As well, in order to allow an enchantment to recharge itself, some [[l|seraphanite|Seraphanite]] dust is often worked into the gold.

# Metals and Alloys

A metal is classified by axiologists as an intrinsic class-2 construct with an easily-manipualted ethereophysical shell, but a very rigid ethereophysical lattice, and an alloy is an class-2 construct uniformly composed of two or more metals. Earlier versions of this definition attempted to describe how &ldquo;metals&rdquo; (both metals and alloys) such as iron, bronze, and tin, tend to be malleable, but maintain their physical properties independent of shape. However, as different metals were discovered and the constituent metals of different alloys were investigated, it was learned that most of the properties &ldquo;metals&rdquo; are more a result of the interplay of different metals in an alloy.

The modern definition attempts to describe how alloys tend to retain some of the properties of their constituent metals, acting more like two fluids mixed together than a new material altogether. This definition also extends to more &ldquo;mineral&rdquo; materials like carbon and silicon, which act as metals despite not possessing the luster or physical maleability of most metals.

It is important to note that this definition is not a chemical or metallurgical definition of a metal, both of which focus more on the mundane properties of an object such as ductility, maleability, and thermal conductivity. The axiological definition of a metal relates solely to how the material behaves with respect to axiological matter.

# Metals

The following is a list of common metals and their axial properties:

* [[a|Copper]] is an excellent conductor of axial matter, both axiopsychogenic matter and ethereophysical shells. It is often used in the conduction of mental intent, as well as connecting sources of axiopsychogenic matter with consuming matrixes.
* [[a|Iron]] is closely bound to the material world. In a highly refined state, it can be used to repel energies tied to other planes.
* [[a|Lead]] absorbs axiopsychogenic matter. It is useful for making barriers to block out magical effects as it can drain the effect of axiopsychogenic matter and render it inert. As it gains axiopsychogenic matter, it turns to gold, removing this property. While gold and lead are complementary metals, one cannot drain or infuse the other directly. Touching lead to gold does not typically drain the gold, though a well-designed copper interface connecting the two materials can.
* [[a|Gold]] stores and releases axiopsychogenic matter. As gold is drained, it becomes lead, and as lead is infused, it becomes gold. However, the draining process oxidizes the lead causing it to crumble into salt.
* [[a|Silver]] supplants and breaks down class-1 ethereophysical shells. Very useful in breaking down spells and magical effects without draining their axiopsychogenic matter, but reactions to heavily-charged constructs may be explosive. This property also applies to the ethereophysical shells some shapeshifters use for changing their form, causing enhanced pain and damage.
* [[a|Zinc]] binds ethereophysical shells. Zinc is useful for maintaining an ethereophysical shell which might otherwise mutate or decay. It essentially freezes the shell in a fixed form.
* [[a|Tin]] projects some ethereophysical shells out some radius proprtional to the volume of tin used. This is useful for creating or enahancing magical barriers and areas of effect.
* [[a|Carbon]] (Graphite) and [[a|Silicon]] see [[l|Programming]].
* [[a|Antimony]] temporarily holds the imprint of an ethereophysical shell imprinted on it. Similar to carbon and silicon, antimony has the ability to have its internal ethereophysical lattice restructured. However, until the other two metals, antimony does not hold its lattice for long. It regularly restructures itself when placed in contact with another restructuring metal to assume the latter's lattice. This makes the metal useful for copying the enchantment of another item, though the lattice gradually fades over time.
* [[a|Mercury]], once infused, maintains an ethereophysical connection across arbitrary distances. Due to the bond, the charge can come from either end. This allows a pool of mercury to see through a drop or vial of mercury at a great distance, as well as sometimes transmitting sound. The techniques for using mercury for divination are not well-known. The snakefolk closely guard the secret.
* [[a|Aluminum]], as long as it remains infused, cannot be damaged by any physical means, though the more force inflicted against it the faster it consumes its axioppsychogenic matter charge.
* [[a|Platinum]] reflects axial mattery. A class-1 axial construct directed at a platinum object will rebound off the surface. 

## Alloys

Alloys combine the effects of different metals, to sometimes interesting effects. Not all alloys have significant properties, as many alloys yield no quantified effect, called "inert" alloys. While there is some tolerance to the composite of alloys, too much of one component of an alloy can render one alloy inert.

* [[a|Brass]] is useful for animatronics, where a mind (copper) is sealed into a body (zinc)
* [[a|Bronze]] is useful for projecting mental control over magic. Typically bronze is wrapped around a control gem to project some magical effect controlled by the mind of the wearer.
* [[a|Steel]] allows metallic weapons to bear enchantments. The carbon inside the steel allows some of its ethereophysical lattice to be reshaped, allowing the metal to be enchanted without the need of gemstones.

# Precious Stones

## Affiliated Gems

Each CABE has a designated gem/stone associated with them. This association is often due to the gemstone having great significance to their ascension or domain. Additionally, some gemstones are associated with multiple CABEs, with their properties intersecting multiple domains. The following list outlines gemstones and their associated CABE(s).

## Unafilliated Gems

These stones are not associated with any particular CABE, but still have special properties. Typically these properties apply too universally to be relegated to any particular CABE.

* [[a|Diamond]] mimics the ethereophysical binding which keeps souls and bodies together. They are instrumental in resurrection magic, which attempts to re-stitch the binding of soul and body. Please not that, diamond, while composed of [[l|carbon|Carbon]] like graphite, cannot be restructured in the same way.
* [[a|Seraphinite]] maintains a connection with the Axis. Despite being more common than a lot of gems, seraphinite is the most precious and expensive gemstone, as it is used in almost every enchanting work. The connection to the axis allows the work to pull axiospychogenic matter from the Axis and recharge itself without requiring a person to push matter into it. The rate at which an item accumulates axiopsychogenic matter is proportional to the amount of seraphinite contained within. Fortunately, very little seraphinite goes a long way when enchanting, and most simple magic items only require a pinch of seraphinite dust to recharge in a day, but even a pinch of dust is a huge portion of a crafting items' expense.
