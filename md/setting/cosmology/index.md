While there are many different faiths, religions, and philosophical perspectives within Makafell, there are some generally-accepted truths of how the cosmos is structured and organized. This section presents the dominant theories, models, and understandings of Makafellan cosmology. Not all of these truths are widely-known, and some of them are secrets known only to few, while some others have been lost to time. 

# The Great Axis

The prominent and almost ubiquitously-accepted model of Makafellan cosmology is referred to as the [[a|Great Axis Cosmological Model]]. According to this model, Makafell exists as a sphere between two polar forces: [[l|Muaham]] (the moon), who represents balance, flatness, and stasis, and [[l|Oruham]] (the sun), who represents imbalance, instability, and vibrancy. Makafell is placed exactly halfway between these two forces. The space surrounding the Axis is referred to as the [[l|Void|The Void]].

It is believed that, at the center point between Muaham and Oruham, the two forces converge, which results in the emmanation of two forms of semiphysical materials. The first, believed to be composed mostly of Muaham, is [[l|ethereophysical matter|Ethereophysical Matter]], while the second, believed to be composed mostly of Oruham, is [[l|axiopsychogenic matter|Axiopsychogenic Matter]]. Collectively, they are referred to as &rdquo;[[l|axial matter|Axial Matter]]&ldquo;.

It is believed that the emmanation of this matter is what allowed creation to occur. At the center point of the axis, matter was spewed forth and, originally, axial constructs were created randomly, without any purpose to motivate them, and simply ejected into the void. Over time, however, some constructs began to take shape. These constructs were first the planes, then the spirits, and finally mortals on Makafell.

The study of the cosmos as it aligns with the Great Axis model is referred to as &ldquo;Axiology&rdquo;.

## Muaham

Muaham is the moon and the embodiment of balance and the stasis which comes from it. Muaham is the source of all things calm and consistent. Things do not change with Muaham, but instead exist in an eternal state of whatever it is, good or evil. Muaham embodies the virtues of justice, order, and loyalty, but also the vices of despair, laziness, and isolation.

## Oruham

Oruham is the sun and the embodiment of motion and the change which comes from it. Oruham pushes things to change and break down. All things blend together in the chaos of Oruham, which breaks down barriers and pushes for change both good and bad. Oruham embodies the virtues of hope, passion, and empathy, but also the vices of injustice, anarchy, and disloyalty.

## The Void

The Void is the space away from the Axis where no clumps of axial matter formed planes or any complex constructs. While Makafell is the point of the greatest concentration of axial matter emanation, there is a lot of axial matter that leaves Makafell and travels onward: into an emptiness away from the Great Axis. This matter can come from the Great Axis itself, from the Oruham conflict, or from spirits who push axial matter away from themselves: burying thoughts, emotions, or memories.  

This rejected axial matter still feels a connection to its source, and seeks re-entry to Makafell. However, the ethereophysical skin surrounding Makafell is too strong for a physical manifestation. So the rejected matter visits its creator when they sleep, seeking to regain a connection. Thus the Void is often considered the realm of nightmares, where repressed fears and thoughts drift in the infinite abyss.

## Axial Matter

By the Great Axis model, everything short of Muaham and Oruham is composed of a combination of an ethereophysical shell filled with axiopsychogenic matter. The ever-changing nature of axiopsychogenic matter makes it impossible to control for any purpose, but the static nature of ethereophysical matter makes it incapable of doing anything or having any substance on its own. Thus, the two must be combined, allowing the ethereophysical shell to shape and direct axiopsychogenic matter, like a cup shaping the water that fills it. Any particular ethereophysical shell filled with axiopsychogenic matter is referred to as an **axial construct**.

The process of pulling axial matter from some source is called **channeling**.

### Ethereophysical Matter

Ehtereophysical matter, sometimes colloquially referred to as **ghost skin**, forms the stabilizing backbone of axial constructs. The component of the axial construct made of ethereophysical matter is referred to as its **ethereophysical shell**. There are two aspects of an ethereophysical shell which govern how it interacts with its axiopsychogenic matter: the **shape** and the **lattice**. The process of creating an ethereophysical shell is called **construction**.

#### Shell Shape

The shape governs the overall geometry of the construct. For simple constructs, this geometry is spacial, determining the three-dimensional appearance of a construct. In more complicated constructs such as portals and temporal effects, the shell can be shaped with six dimension, with dimensions for time, movement along the great axis, and movement away from the great axis adding to the three spacial dimensions. Mortals have more difficulty shaping ethereophysical shells with the axial dimensions than extraplanar entities, and both have extreme difficulty shaping in the temporal dimension.

There are theories that there are other dimensions beyond the six. Some axiologists interpret love as evidence that ehtereophysical shells can establish and maintain connections despite arbitrary changes in position, time, or axial motion. This would then imply the existence of at least one other dimension.

However, opponents to this theory argue the perceived connection is a matter of changes in etherophysical shape caused by either direct or indirect construct interaction, and that no real connection exists, though the two sides may feel a lingering sense of the other construct via the imprint or echo the other construct left with its interaction.

The process of creating or altering an ethereophysical shell&rsquo;s shape is called **molding**.

#### Shell Lattice

The lattice of an ethereophysical shell can be likened to the shell&rsquo;s material, though, for physical constructs, the material is mostly a reflection of the shell&rsquo;s shape. The lattice determines how axiopsychogenic matters moves through, around, and into the construct. It determines how the construct interacts with other constructs, and how it channels axiopsychogenic matter.

The process of forming an ethereophysical lattice is called **composing**. Destroying an ethereophysical lattice to reuse the matter for something else is **decomposing**. And altering a construct&rsquo;s ethereophysical lattice is called **recomposing**.

### Axiopsychogenic Matter

Axiopsychogenic matter, sometimes colloquially referred to as **soul matter**, fills the axial construct with the dynamic energy required to interact with other constructs and maintain itself. Axiopsychogenic matter is the powerhouse of an axial construct, but in its unshaped, or **raw**, form it is chaotic and uncontrollable.

Without axiopsychogenic matter, the ethereophysical shell would break down due to the pressure exerted from outside constructs. However, without an ethereophysical shell, the axiopsychogenic matter would have no net effect on outside constructs, rendering it essentially useless.

The process of pushing axiopsychogenic matter into or through an ethereophysical shell is **pumping**.
