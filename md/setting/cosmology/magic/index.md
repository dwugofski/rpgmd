In Makafell, magic is generally understood to be the art of taking raw [[l|axial matter|Axial Matter|cosmos]] and creating an axial construct directly from it. This means manually crafting or recomposing an ethereophysical shell at a lattice-level and filling it with raw axiopsychogenic matter. 

While mundane actions such as hammering a piece of metal do technically reshape an ethereophysical shell, such actions are not interpreted as changing the underlying ethereophysical lattice, so are not considered magic.
