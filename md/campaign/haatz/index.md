Entering Haatz, the party's goal is to restore the totem to Exanell. However,
despite everyone saying Exanell's totem is stronger than those of the other
Sublimes, the assumed totem: The Library of Xechen, is currently destroyed and
abandoned... or so it seems.

This chapter has been broken down into three stages for the party to complete:

1. **Learning the Fate of the Library**: First, the party will need to
investigate the library to determine if it truly is the totem to Exanell, and,
if not / so, how to restore the totem. This chapter ends when the party learns
that Lord Coztic holds the crown which will return Ux's mind.
2. **Getting into Lord Coztic's Party**: Knowing that Lord Coztic holds the key
to restoring the totem to Exanell, the party needs to get into his apartments
inside Ochitlath Keep to take the item. However, the keep is nigh impregnible,
and the party's only real hope of entry would be one of the parties the Duke
holds for the nobles and their esteemed guests. A noble family might be willing
to give the party an invite, but only in return for a favor.
3. **Confronting Hastur**: After the party goes awry and the keep and city have
started getting sucked into Carcosa, the party must confront Hastur and free
the city.
