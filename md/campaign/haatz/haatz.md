# [[a|Overview]]

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/haatz/haatz_river.jpg|The view of Haatz from the Oilchikab delta|flavor]]

## [[a|Background]]

### [[a|City History]]

Named after the famed Zalazichan explorer Haatz Kinopu who charted Nochutbawar (The Sunset Desert), Haatz was the first Goled settlement of the aforementioned desert. Various nomadic tribes wandered the desert before the Goled Empire settled it, but Haatz was the first city. 

Originally, Haatz was simply a trading post. It was--and remains to this day--a convenient port for river trade through the Nochutbawar. While Cono occupies a similar position to the east, Haatz's relative proximity to the sea gives it a stronger position as a trading hub. 

Compared to most other cities of comparable size, Haatz has played a relatively minor role in Zalazichan history. While its economic significance and logistic remoteness may make it seem a prime target for invasion, is too engrained in Nochutbawar to be of interest to Cizlez, and it is too far west to be of interest to Clezballo. Sezethul briefly used it as his foothold in Zalazich during his invasion, but when the Pache Kingdom struck against the Eidech Kingdom, he withdrew.

The only real noteworthy event in Haatz's history occurred near the beginning of the 11th era. Following the instability of Lagram's Exile, two pale-elven
vampires (Yujexl and Olikema Hechechj, both about 100 years old at the time) moved into Haatz and began maneuvering themselves as nobles through seduction, marriage, and murder. They took their time, but after a century established themselves as the Duke and Duchess of Haatzai. 

A handful of generations have passed since Yujexl and Olikema first moved the Haatz. To maintain their disguise, whenever it is necessary for a child to be born, Olikema feigns pregnancy while a truly-expectant mother is kidnapped and hidden. When the mother gives birth, the mother is killed and the child is presented as Olikema's. The child is raised to give the appearance of a family. As time progresses, when in public, the parents are disguised to appear to age.

Some time into adolescence, the child is killed. After enough time, when people will attribute any changes in appearance to maturity, the relevant parent is disguised as the former child, and begins to take their place. The "parent" then falls ill and dies. The child begins courting, inevitably settling on a young companion who resembles their surviving parent. The "parent" then dies and the new spouse takes his/her place, completing the transition.

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/haatz/haatz_library.jpg|The Library of Xechen|flavor]]

#### [[a|The Library of Xechen]]
Additionally of note is the Library of Xechen. Constructed during the Sublime's reign by Xechen, a zealot of Exanell, it is considered to be the largest library in Makafell aside from the Library of Gol. While the hot desert may seem like an odd place for a temple dedicated to the CABE of forewinter, the dry air acts as a natural preservative for the books, and its position as an other-wise isolated trading hub makes it a nice location for those who trade in secrets.

Xechen was intensely paranoid about having the books in the library stolen. He spent his life weaving ever-increasingly convoluted protections around the library. By the time of his death, the Library of Xechen has become a fortress of magical defenses to keep its books from being lost or stolen. It established a reputation as the only library on Makafell impervious to the loss of written works that plagues Makafell.

To ensure his legacy would never be lost, Xechen passed his same priorities and practices to his successor, and each successor since has either maintained or added to the wards around the library. However, when Atzivec brought his force to bear against the library, Ezlavin, the (el.sk / m / e) librarian at the time was unable to match their strength.

Unwilling to let Atzivec get his hands on the knowledge inside the library, during an intense magical barrage by Atzivec's mages Ezlavin dropped the wards, killing himself and destroying the library in the process. All the books in the library were scorched, and formerly-glorious library was in ruins.

### [[a|Under the Atzivecan Empire]]

Given the short and successful campaign against the Uchex Dominion for Cizlez and Uchilan, the city of Haatz remains standing as proud as ever. It was the only city to have never even attempted a resistance against Atzivec, as they freely surrendered to his armies. Its intact status has made it a second capital of sorts.

While most cities in Zalazich have experienced a degree of decay over the decades with most of their resources going towards meeting the quota, Haatz has remained as a bastion of civility, culture, and refinement in a dark and dreary Zalazich. This is thanks to a deal struck between Atzivec and Duke Quiliot (then Duke Equelot). For allowing his troops to enter Haatz unchallenged, and for agreeing to grant nobility and unflinching support to Coztic Tlatoani, Atzivec would leave Haatz untouched.

Haatz is the city in Zalazich with the largest excess of essential commodities like meat, grain, and lumber. While every city has excesses of some goods, the lack of quota enforcement on Haatz gives it the most wealth. Thus Haatz is a prime trading stop on trading routes. The exotic appetites of the Haatz nobles are notorious, and provide a motivation for most other villages and cities to devote some production to the less quota-relevant goods that they want.

Fashion, art, and luxury are of extreme importance to the relatively large middle class of the city. Trends come and go with frightening speed. Haatz is in constant turmoil as clothing, food, decoration, furniture, and even landscaping varies on a day-to-day basis. Enormous waste is created as unfashionable goods are cycled out for fashionable, allowing only the wealthiest to keep pace. In Haatz, one's social standing is determined by one's ability to adapt to emerging trends.

The one unchanging aspect of Haatz is the lingering presence of the ruins of the Library of Xechen. While the city has evolved, the ruins remain.

#### [[a|Noble Houses]]

The political power of Haatz is divided between eight noble houses. House Hechechi tops the hierarchy as the house of the Duke/Duchess. Each house has its own responsibilities. Hechechi act as enforcers, ensuring each house maintains its duties. Many of these duties are to regulate economic activity within the city, making the associated noble houses the effective "guilds" of those industries.

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/haatz/haatz_court.jpg|The Hechechi court of Haatz|flavor]]

House Hechechi keeps the nobles at each others' throats in one form or another. They have beguiled and enthralled the nobles, so each house is vying for their attention and favor. They throw elaborate balls, adorn themselves in distinct styles, and pay close attentions to the moods and vicissitudes of Quiliot and Enquilia so they can match their desires. This has led to an ever-changing and ever-evolving competition by each of the noble houses to stay in vogue.

Behind the scenes, Hechechi takes great pains to maintain order and stability between the houses. They pressure the lesser nobles to do their bidding. To keep the houses from expanding, Quiliot and Enquilia will strategically cull members of the noble families, and disguise their murders as accidents.

<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Ochitlath Keep]]</div>
* Real name is Yujexl Hechechi. He pretends to be 57 years old, but is really 659.
* Has short copper-red hair folded back smoothly in a tight wave. He has an air of aloof, imperious bemusement. At parties the duke can be found in the center of sychophants who work to please and amuse him. Though he gives them his attention, he rarely speaks. What few words he does use are taken with great weight, as all seek to understand his desires to please him. 

<div class="header">[[a|Duchess Enquilia Hechechi|Duke Quiliot]] (m el.pa [vampire] a) <br/> 
Title: <em>Duchess of Haatzai</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Ochitlath Keep]]</div>
* Real name is Olikema Hechechi. She pretends to be 53 years old, but is really 653.
* Has long wavy blonde hair flowing to her waist, with several thin braids interspersed within. She has an outgoing, extroverted personality, though she never shouts or raises her voice. With her charm and grace, conversation is effortless, and many find themselves trusting her more than they would their closest friends. 

<div class="header">[[a|Lord Coztic Tlatoani|Hastur]] [Hastur] (m hu.za a) <br/> 
Title: <em>Baron of the Citrine Isles</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Ochitlath Keep]]</div>
* Secretly the Great Old One Hastur
* A tall man wearing a golden mask and hood that completely obscures his face.

While the eyes remain black circles, people can sense his glare when he is angry.
* Lord Coztic is a refined, educated gentleman. While accentric, most of those who meet him leave with fond memories of a close and trusted friend. While many seek to please the Hechechis, Coztic engenders a sense of familiarity, comfort, and ease.

## [[a|Noble Houses]]

Haatz is divided into eight noble houses. Each noble house is responsible for maintaining some aspect of the Haatzai region. The heads of each house have the authority of a count, though only a few of the houses actually are counts. The only exception are the heads of house Hechechi, who are the duke/duchess of Haatzai. Each noble house maintains a number of vassal houses to oversee specific operations. These vassal houses are still noble, but maintain the title of barons.

### [[a|House Kat]]

House Kat is responsible for masonry and transportation. They are responsible for maintaining the roads and trade in the region, as well as seeing to the quarries. They get first pick of trade goods going into/out of Haatz. They also oversee the sculptors of Haatz.

Their position grants them knowledge of the routes and schedules of trade caravans and ships across the region. This places House Kat as the information brokers of Haatz. Hechechi uses them to sow disinformation throughout the nobles of Haatz.

### [[a|House Uaynih]]

House Uaynih is responsible for the military of the region. While every noble house has its own private guard, and the barons' cities are overseen by their own forces, the training for all troops in the region is managed by House Uaynih. As well, the city guard for Haatz itself is overseen by House Uaynih, as House Uaynih maintains the county of Haatz.

Hechechi uses them to keep track of military strengths/weakenesses of the different houses. House Uaynih also trains assassins for Hechechi.

<div class="header">[[a|Countess Citlai Uaynih|Citlai]] (f hu.ciz ma (44)) <br/>

* A shy artist, who keeps her feelings mostly to herself, intimidated by her powerful father
* Secretly in love with [[l|Lemuhl]]

### [[a|House Kisin]]

House Kisin are the farmers of Haatz and counts of Maqui. They are also the house of chefs and culinary training. They also oversee the alchemists and physicians of the region. This grants them access to poisons, which some houses, especially Hechechi, use in assassinations.

<div class="header">[[a|Countess Tlali Kisin|Tlali]] (f el.pa e (154)) <br/> 
Title: <em>Countess of Maqui</em><br/>

* Secretly in love with [[l|Kiraza]]

### [[a|House Steelgad]]

House Steelgad are the counts of Chanail and miners, gems, jewelers, and smiths of the region. They are the least coordinated politically, which is partly why Hechechi allowed them their station.

<div class="header">[[a|Count Bodi Steelgad|Bodi]] (m dw a (33)) <br/> 
Title: <em>Count of Chanail</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Steelgad Estate]]</div>
* Unruly brown hair and beard with green eyes. 
* Expresses himself through metal plats draped over his body.
* Irresponsible and hedonistic. Inexperienced, since both his father (Ajzak) and older brother (Tzacol) were killed (by Hechechi, who felt house Steelgad was getting too coordinated and capable of undermining their deal with Atzivec).

### [[a|House Ixmuca]]

House Ixmuca are the overseers of the meat (including hunting), livestock, and textile industries. They are responsible for the clothing designers and decorators of the region. 

<div class="header">[[a|Lord Mental Ixmuca|Mental]] (m hu.za e (74)) <br/>

young lord has sought to woo their way into his heart by bedding Zath, but, much
to their heartbreaking dismay, none has succeeded

[[l|Velveteen]] district are just to meet up with various men of the night.

### [[a|House Tepin]]

House Tepin are the leaders of the criminal underworld of Haatz. They are responsible for making sure the criminal underbelly of the city stays in line with Hechechi's goals. They are also the only house to know of the nature of House Hechechi. It's a symbiotic relationship that gives House Tepin a degree of immunity from the social game of Haatz. The other houses dismiss House Tepin as a minor house, barely above their vassals, and, despite petty squabbles, will often share joy in mocking House Tepin behind Colal&rsquo;s back.

House Tepin also sees to and maintains the only orphanage in Haatz. It is the most well-maintained orphanage in Zalazich. The house is well-regarded among the poor for their charity work, though the other noble houses mostly see it as a waste of money.

<div class="header">[[a|Lady Colal Tepin|Colal]] (f hu.clez e (90)) <br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Tepin Estate]]</div>
* Tall and thin, with a bald head and piercing blue eyes which contrast her dark skin.
* Irreverent, cynical, and cocky in her old age
* Was forced to kill her daughter (Yatzil) after telling her about the nature of House Hechechi. Yatzil threatened to expose the vampires, and Colal could not allow that. 
* She has to tell her granddaughter ([[l|Coleita]]) about House Hechechi when it is time for the young woman to assume the duties of House Tepin, but worries Coleita will have the same reaction as her mother.
* Killing Yatzil forged a wedge between House Hechechi and Lady Colal. Though she hides it well, House Hechechi is aware of the bad feelings, and has started making preparations against Colal.
* Colal would never risk the fallout of betraying House Hechechi, both for herself, her familily, and the innocents of Haatz. She hopes Coleita will understand the risks and feel the same.

<div class="header">[[a|Lady Coleita Tepin|Coleita]] (f hu.clez ya (22)) <br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Tepin Estate]]</div>
* Tall, thin, and blue-eyed like her grandmother, with three ponytails descending from an otherwise-shaved skull.
* Ruthlessly efficient in her operation of house affairs. She longs for approval from her grandmother, but resents her for not providing it.

# [[a|Organizations]]

## [[a|Arcane Magisterium]]

With the nobles of Haatz constantly concerned with keeping up with the latest fashions, trying to get a leg up on their rivals, and staying in House Hachechi&rsquo;s good graces, Zaniya saw a golden opportunity to establish herself as a divination expert in Haatz. This has earned her a position of prestige among the nobles of Haatz, who compensate her greatly for her readings.

<div class="header">[[a|Zaniya Paton|Zaniya]] (f el.sk a) <br/>
Title: <em>Principle Magistrate</em> (Senior Magistrate)<br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Arcane Magisterium HQ]]</div>
* A warm and jovial woman with an inviting, exciting, and exotic allure to her makeup and garb, which she styles like the sea elven Tideseers of Pitzilan: clothes with a roguish and manly cut that still highlights one's feminine profile. However, Zaninya has adapted the sea wiches' usually-plain dressings with a show of wealth, with many superfluous flowing silks and decorative pendants, charms, baubles, and filigree woven into the shirt and trousers.
* Zaninya is not a brilliant wizard, but she is ambitious. While she has no particular passion for magical research, she knew the Arcane Magisterium was an unpassable opportunity for future wealth, and worked hard to rise the ranks. Now that she has a business venture that seems without end, she is happy to rest on her laurels, maintaining her clients' approval, but not being overly concerned about making new magical discoveries.
* Zaninya styles herself as an important woman in Haatzan society, and, indeed, she is. The nobles and wealthy in the city constantly visit her for insight into coming trends and business opportunities. She could easily sway people towards certain courses of action, but would not take such risks without sufficient motivation.

<div class="header">[[a|T'mqul Zicn|T'mqul]] (m hu.za ma) <br/>Title: <em>Docent</em> (High Magistrate)<br/><strong>Location</strong>: [[l|The Old Lamb Inn]]</div>

* Resembling a lumberjack in build and beard, T'mqul is an friendly, if a bit imposing man. He is welcoming to all, and enjoys conversation with all sorts of company. Despite his keen mind and impressive accomplishments, he bears none of the stereotypical arrogance or aloofness of most mages.
* T'mqul is an wizard proficient in enchantment magics. He rose in rank due to his discoveries involving a method to temporarily bypass the glutiligmal membrane surrounding class-4 axial constructs, allowing one to directly manipulate the class-3 sub-construct and later impose those changes on the class-2 sub-construct, rather than go about the traditional method of having to manipulate both sub-constructs concurrently. This method substantially improves the ease with which a wizard can construct permanent enchantment spells.
* His current research efforts are investigating the application of enchantment spells to rectify the defects in the class-3 sub-construct lattice of the mentally infirm. His research is currently purely in the passive phase: studying the shape of the mind.
* A few weeks ago, he received orders to assist Zaniya in her research for the next few months. However, upon arriving, Zaniya refused his help (she worries he has been sent to spy / replace her), so he has had nothing to do but twiddle his thumbs.

<div class="header">[[a|Zuma Nochyacatle]] (f el.sk a) <br/>

Title: <em>Research Assistant</em> (Agent)</div>

<div class="header">[[a|Itzli Quiauhim]] (m ha ya) <br/>
Title: <em>Research Assistant</em> (Agent)</div>

## [[a|Domestic Magisterium]]

With Haatz exempt from the quota system, there is very little need for a strong Domestic Magisterium presence in the city. However, since the rest of the Haatzai region still requires monitoring, some presence is still required. It is just that no Grey Guard roam the city.

<div class="header">[[a|Regional Supervisory Magistrate Ajtzak|Ajtzak]] (m el.su ma [Dendrite]) <br/>
Title: <em>High Magistrate</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Domestic Magisterium HQ]]</div>
* A shorter man, even by human standards, who wears a slightly modified version of the magistrate's uniform with stylistic flares that manage to give him an air of fashionability without detracting from the uniform's standard black severity.
* Ajtzak is a meticulous man, and he gets inordinately flustered with any disturbance to his routine or organization. 
* Ajtzak is aware of who the Hechechi are. His orders are simply to observe, ensure the quotas are enforced for the other cities in the Haatzai, and represent Atzivec's interests in the region. He participates in the game of Haatzai, but as an equal to house Hechechi. He does not play against Hechechi in spirit, rather, he teases them or challenges them to keep the game interesting.

## [[a|Phantagorical Cognituum]]

## [[a||Jaguar Slayers]]

<div class="header">[[a|Yaluk Zoltz|Yaluk]] (m gn a (76)) <br/>
Title: <em>Coordinator</em><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Domestic Magisterium HQ]]</div>
* A man with long, smooth blonde hair mostly held back in short ponytail, with several noticeable locks having escaped and made their way chaotically over his head. He wears a long light-brown coat with several burned patches and scorch marks throughout. His face is slightly sooted itself, though light circles frame his eyes, clearly protected from whatever soiled his face by the pair of google perched above his head.
* To most people, Yaluk is a quiet man who keeps to himself and appears totally engrossed in his business: making fireworks. However, he is a deeply passionate man, and, if one gets him talking about something that interests him, he will go on for hours on the subject unabated.
* Yaluk is no fan of the decadent nobility of Haatz, whom he sees as wasteful. He knows the other cities of Haatzai are suffering, and is frustrated with how uncaring the city nobles seem. As the best fireworks craftsman in the city, he is able to charge high prices to the nobles for his craft, and he uses the profits to benefit families across Haatzai as he is able to. This is how he established connections to the Jaguar Slayers of Haatzai and is how he ultimately came to be a Coordinator.

## [[a|Keyshakers]]

In Haatz, the Keyshakers, run by [[l|Lady Colal Tepin|Colal]], oversees all
operations of the lower criminal organizations. Unlike most cities, where the
Keyshakers only have a dominant hand due to their inter-city coordination, Lady
Colal effectively oversees all the affairs of the lower gangs and the Keyshakers
have no direct involvement in crime.

<div class="header">[[l|Lady Colal Tepin|Colal]]<br/>Title: <em>Boss</em><br/><strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Tepin Estate]]</div>
* See [[l|Lady Colal Tepin|Colal]]

## [[a|Golden River Pirates]]

The Golden River Pirates are responsible for raids around the city and thefts
involving goods that are going into / out of the city.

<div class="header">[[a|Egruvml Tenm|Egruvml]] (m gn a)<br/>Title: <em>Boss</em><br/><strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Golden River HQ]]</div>
* A gruff, many-scarred gnomish man who is more than willing to gut anyone
foolish enough to think his short statue makes him less capable to handle a
fight.
* Brought the golden sands up with his keen with and tactical mind. Not a fool,
and not one to take risks likely.

## [[a|Summer Suns Gang]]

The Summer Suns are the main footpads and thieves within the city.

<div class="header">[[a|Ikilra]] (f el.sh a)<br/>Title: <em>Boss</em><br/><strong>Location</strong>: [[l|Summer Suns HQ]]</div>
* Wears a mask covered in obsidian and clothes which obscure every inch of her
skin. She carries herself with a relaxed air, but she speaks with hints of
judgement and scorn.
* Was "rescued" as a child from an elven raid against a group of nomadic shadow
elves along the Cizlez / Biltnich border, by an elven soldier who could not bear
to kill a child. The soldier (Ikilra never knew his name) was later killed by
his neighbors in his village who though Ikilra would be a curse. During the
fight, the soldier helped Ikilra escaped, and she made her way into Haatz, where
Colal took her in, showed her kindness, and taught her the craft of thieves.
* Treats her crew as her family, and feels any attack on one of them is an
attack on all.
* Secretly sees Lady Colal has her mother, and is jealous of Coalita, whom she
thinks is unworthy of following in her mother's footsteps. Ikilra started
covering her skin because she views Coalita's heirdom as further punishment for
her race.

# [[a|Locations]]

[[img|../../../res/img/campaign/haatz/haatz_city_dm.png|A map of Haatz|flavor]]

## [[a|Districts]]

### [[a|Hawkperch]]

The Hawkperch district is one of the main entrances for traders and travelers passing through Haatz. It houses the largest concentration of Inns and Stables inside the city walls. 

### [[a|Velveteen]]

The Velveteen district earned its name for two reasons. First, it houses a large number of luxurious textile craftsmen who work with the silks and exotic cloths from Clezballo. Second, it houses the highest concentration of mid-quality brothels and houses of ill repute, which service their clients on beds of fine linen, assuming they can afford it. 

### [[a|Barleybreath]]

The Barleybreath district is one of two major dock districts in Haatz. Trade along the eastern Oilchikab river mostly deals with grains and foodstuffs from the north, making their way south to feed the southern front. While most of the food which makes its way through Haatz is part of the quota system and managed by the Domestic Magisterium, merchants will sell some of their extra haul to Haatz.

### [[a|Southshore]]

The Southshore district is home to the middle class of Haatz. These are traders and organizers who work with the noble houses to manage shipments and goods. 

### [[a|Glitterhand]]

The Glitterhand is the poorest district in Haatz. It is practically a slum, with tents and temporary houses constructed from the near-ruins that make up the chaotic heart of Haatz. 

### [[a|Gateward]]

The Gateward is known as the roughest district in Haatz. While Glitterhand may house cutpurses and thieving urchins, the Gateward district is where the Summer Sands operate from. Additionally, it has the largest concentration of dive bars in Haatz, all in business to support the sailors from the Saltsweat and Barleybreath districts. At night, those rowdy sailors, deep in their cups, make the streets an unsafe place to be.

### [[a|Lanterntown]]

The lower-middle-class of Haatz, Lanterntown is where many pentioners retire after their service to the nobles. It is a sleepy neighborhood, though relatively safe and well-maintained.

### [[a|Sweetwater]]

The Sweetwater district is the middle-class district of Haatz formed by the artisans and craftsmen who make a living catering to the whims of the nobles. To woo the attentions of nobles, artisans will show off their wares and goods, making the district a cacaophy of elaborate works of art, which change frequently based on shifting fads.

### [[a|Saltsweat]]

The Saltsweat district is the second of two major dock districts in Haatz. Trade along the western Chuvebnal river deals mainly with Maqui and the natural resources of eastern Haatzai.

### [[a|Northshore]]

The Northshore district is the upper-middle-class district of Haatz. Here, the would-be nobles: distant cousins and vassal houses, live their lives and engage in their own social games.

## [[a|Places of Interest]]

### [[a|The Keep]]

<div class="header">[[a|Ochitlath Keep]]<br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: Southwest of <em>[[l|Sweetwwater]]</em></div>
Ochitlath Keep towers over the two rivers on either side of it. It has several steps which descend down to the short, and its central tower serves as a lighthouse for ships wishing to navigate at night.

merchants

	* Stout, salt-of-the-Earth man with a straightforward demeanor and an easy-
	to-get-along-with personality. Willing to talk your ear off if he gets the
	chance, but just as quick to leave you alone if you look like you want to
	be
	* Has no interest in the game of Haatz

### [[a|Notable Locations]]

<div class="header">[[a|Kinopu Square]]<br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: Center of the City</div>

Kinopu Square is the main gathering square of Haatz. Here, people meet to share news, sell wares, and discuss ideas. It is where the everyday citizens of Haatz can meet and interact with one another. As it is too crowded and busy for any nobles to want to attend, it is also where artists go to practice their craft free from the critical eyes of those obsessed with fads. It is more genuine cultural hub of Haatz.

<div class="header">[[a|The Library of Xechen|Library of Xechen]]<br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: Southwest of the [[l|Arcane Magisterium HQ]]</div>

Off an overgrown path in southern Haatz, a tower stands overlooking the city, raised on a hill and elevated even beyond the tower of Ochitlath Keep. This is the Library of Xechen, the former glory of Haatz. Now, this ruined library barely stands as a cairn of blackened stones teetering on the brink of collapse.
