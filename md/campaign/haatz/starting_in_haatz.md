[[navbar|Investigation in Haatz|./index.md]]

# Overview

The party arrives in Haatz with only the knowledge that Exanell's totem is
somewhere in the city, and, while dormant, has not been taken over by a dark
force in the same way the other totems have. The other Sublimes believe
Exanell's totem is the Library of Xechen, but, as the library is destroyed and
the totem is definitely intact, it is most likely something else. Still, the
Library of Xechen is the first lead to help the party discover and restore the
totem.

The general course of their investigation should progress as follows:

1. Party pointed to the "Tower of Ux" (Library of Xechen) and Ux
2. Party consults with T'mqul Zicn, who reveals that Ux needs "his crown" to
fix his memories
3. Party asks around; House Steelgrad's records could hold more details
4. House Ixmuca purchased it from an antiquarian in the city
5. House Kisin received it from House Ixmuca as payment for healing / poison
6. [[l|haatz::Kiraza]] (of house Kahau) received it from Lord
[[l|haatz::Lemuhl]] in secret
7. House Kat has records of Lady Kirala's caravan to Ulitz, but the caravan was
robbed and the crown stolen
8. House Uaynih was responsible for tracking down the brigands; they are the
Summer Suns Gang, based in Haatz, but only the crown was stolen, and, there was
nothing to tie the leader ([[l|haatz::Ikilra]]) to the theft.
9. Party raids / interrogates the Summer Suns Gang and learns the theft was
comissioned by Lord Coztic Tlatoani

## [[a|Background]]

### [[a|The Totem of Exanell]]

The Library of Xechen is, in fact, the totem of Exanell. Before it could fall,
the previous librarian, Ezlavin, made it look like he had blown up the library
and destroyed it (see [[l|haatz::The Library of Xechen]]). In truth, the
explosion and the damage was an illusion.

Instead, Ezlavin sacrificed himself to create an insanely complex, persistent
disguise around the library to keep people from realizing it was not destroyed.
His assitant, Helnux, would be able to see through the disguise, and would see
to maintaining the enchantments around the library. However, to prevent the
mind reading of the Voidspawn from learning the truth of the library from
Helnux, Ezlavin and Helnux scrambled the assistant's mind, and left the key to
unscrambling it in a crown, kept secure in the library until such a time that
the totem could be safely restored. In the meantime, Helnux would essentially
be a madman, and, soon after the crown took away his mind, could only refer to
himself as Ux.

In response to the first totem awakening, and with the Sublimes counciling that
the totems were being restored, Exanell requested Helnux to restore his mind and
re-open the library so that she could once again reach out to her worshippers.
However, Helnux discovered the crown had been stolen: a feat which would have
only been possible by someone of extreme power to see through and break the
illusion.

### [[a|Helnux's Crown]]

The crown that took away Helnux's mind was a copper circlet with larimar gems in
the front. The crown removed important memories which made Helnux who he was.
Without those memories, his mind fractured and became a jumbled mess.

### [[a|The Tower of Ux]]

So much time has passed since the Library of Xechen has been the Library of
Xechen that the townsfolk don't even refer to it as that. Ux took residence in
the tower some time after the empire burned the tower down, and he's been in
there ever since.

The enchantments on the tower are designed to go unnoticed and get people to
pass by the tower without a second thought. The enchantments are level 9
arcane illusion magic effects. There are four layers of spells designed to
prevent people from realizing the tower is intact.

The widest-reaching effect prevents the tower from being noticed passively;
everyone may know it's there, but unless they're thinking about it, they pass
by without giving it another thought.

The second affect projects a sense of tenuousness and fragility to the tower.
The gently swaying, creaking, and rumbling from the illusion causes people
inside to feel like the whole tower is about to collapse and fall in on them.

The third, most complex effect projects the illusion that the tower is falling
apart, despite the fact that the tower is fully intact and standing. This
illusion distorts a person's spatial awareness, distorting distances and
changing how items interact to maintain the illusion. It adapts to fit the
expectations of the visitor.

Most interestingly, it can even inject itself into the mind of a visitor,
convincing them and those around them that an illusory item taken from the tower
(the illusion ensures nothing of true substance leaves the tower) is real. The
illusion does not maintain its presence for longer than an hour, though, but it
will try to find a convenient motivation for the taker to drop or lose track of
the item (such as appearing very gross / slimey).

The last layer is the protection of the library and its books. This layer is
composed of the wards passed down over the centuries. The only new addition is
a layer of spells to hide those effects.

## [[a|Introducing T'mqul Zicn|Introducing T'mqul]]

See the [[l|T'mqul Zicn|haatz::T'mqul]] section in the Haatz city notes for more
details on the wizard.

It is important to introduce T'mqul Zicn as early as possible upon arriving to
Haatz. Perhaps he is staying at the first inn they visit, or the first tavern
they seat at, and he approaches them as a fellow traveler. He is especially
eager to converse with any mages within the party, as he loves discussing the
arcane and debating topics. He has found intellectual discourse somewhat lacking
in Haatz, and is looking for stimulating conversation with remarkable
individuals. He will make himself known to the party.

At the earliest opportunity, he will discuss his field of research: using
enchantment magic for medicinal purposes: curing those afflicted by mental
illnesses by influencing the ethereophysical patterns within the mind. His
research is entirely theoretical at this point, and it would be extremely
unethical to test any of his reparative theories out on a living person, but he
is quite skilled at scrying the mind and diagnosing the nature of different
illnesses. This area of research will be extremely useful to the party.

```
It is not a coincidence that T'mul is present in Haatz with the party. He was
directed there by Hrogthl in anticipation of the party's arrival, so that he
could help them discover the nature of Ux's affliction.
```

If the party learns of Ux and his illness earlier than T'mqul's introduction,
the party can be pointed to T'mqul by consulting people. A helpful soul might
connect Ux to T'mqul by saying something like, "I heard that new wizard in town
is studying madness or some sort. Wonder if he's been involved with Ux."

# Starting the Investigation

The investigation into Exanell's totem can start pretty much anywhere in the
city. Most likely, it will start with the party either going to the [[l|Old
Lamb Inn|haatz::The Old Lamb Inn]] or to the Library of Xechen itself. The
initial stage of the investigation is concerned with locating Ux and getting
T'mqul to examine him, revealing the tampering with his mind and the need for
the crown.

Some leads to get the party moving are outlined in the following sections.
Please be sure to [[l|introduce T'mqul|Introducing T'mqul]] as early as
possible.

## Learning about the Crown

The goal of the first part of the investigation is to get the party to speak
with Ux and start looking for his crown. Talking with anyone in the city about
[[l|haatz::The Library of Xechen]] will get them to mention Ux, the madman who
lurks in the tower. If the party travels to the library, Ux will be waiting
inside.

[[a|Speaking with Ux]]: As the party approaches the library, Ux will creak open
the door at shout at them to stay away. He is agoraphobic and reclusive, not
wanting to speak with the party and not wanting them near the tower. The party
as well gets a sense of unease as they approach the tower, feeling as though
it is on the verge of collapse (see [[l|The Tower of Ux]] for details).

If they party mentions that they are seeking the Totem of Exanell, Ux will get
upset, yell in agony, and insist they leave as he claims to have no idea what
they are talking about (a `DC 15 Sense Motive` check will reveal he is lying,
and, even on a failure, they can tell that them mentioning the totem hurt him).
If the party claims they are working for Exanell, or if they leave, Ux will hear
from Exanell that he should let them in, so he will.

Speaking with Ux is difficult (see [[l|Roleplaying Ux]] below for details), but
the wizard does attempt to communicate the nature of the affliction befalling
him and the tower. Before leaving, the party should have an understanding that
Ux knows how to help the party, but his affliction keeps him unable to. This
should lead the party to talk with [[l|T'mul Zicn|Introducing T'mqul]], assuming
they are familiar with the wizard and his specialization.

[[a|Roleplaying Ux]]: While everyone else sees the library in its destroyed
state, Ux is still able to see it in its full glory. As well, being Exanell's
high priest in Zalazich, Ux is able to commune with her agents and hear messages
from his goddess. Sadly, these factors combined have led the people of Haatz to
conclude that Ux is insane: hearing voices and seeing hallucinations.

Due to the psychic surgery Ezlavin performed on him, Ux was unable to properly
understand the nature of the library, his relationship with Exanell, or his role
in preserving the library during its slumber. Without the knowledge of why he
was able to perceive things others could not, Ux started to believe everyone
else's claims that he was insane, so he sought refuge in the library, where he
felt safe and distant from others.

Over a century of self-isolation have made Ux antisocial: borderline paranoid
around others. With this isolation, his social skills of declined, as his only
companion has been the voice of Kilizenal, a male angel of Exanell who has been
assigned to look over and monitor Ux. Kilizenal and Ux are good friends, though
Ux believes Kilizenal is a figment of his delusions. Still, as his only
companion, Ux talks regularly with Kilizenal.

Only Ux's personal memories and his understanding of his situation were stored
in the crown. His ability to reason and his perception of reality are all
fully-functioning. However, his insistence that the tower is intact and his
constant chatting and consulting with Kilizenal present the appearance that he
is insane. Additionally, without any real knowledge of who he is, where he is,
or what he is doing, Ux is easily confused and distracted, adding to his
addle-minded appearance.

While conversing with others, Ux will mutter to himself constantly; he does not
really have a verbal filter. He will also talk to Kilizenal often, sharing his
impressions of the party members and consulting with the angel as if the party
were not standing there. Not having had people in the library before, Ux will
regularly check with Kilizenal on what he should say and how he should act.

If the party asks Ux about the library, Ux will remark about how beautiful it
is, and how wonderful it has been staying there. He will remark that the tower
has always been his home, for as long as he can remember, though that is only
as far as the Atzivecan conquests. Asking him questions about the totem of
Exanell will cause him to clutch his head as he experiences great pain. Any
mention or conversation about the totem will be agony for Ux, and he will beg
the party to stop talking or asking about it.

Kilizenal is the one who vouched for the party on their arrival to the library.
If the party is having trouble determining what to do next, Kilizenal will
get Ux to relay a message to the party concerning a wizard in an inn who may be
able to help.

[[a|Taking Ux to T'mul]]: If the party takes Ux to T'mul, the wizard will
reluctantly accept the responsibility to see what he can do for the elf. The
procedure to look into Ux's mind will take approximately 1 hour, during which
time Ux will be placed into a semi-conscious state and T'mul will explore the
landscape of his mind.

After the procedure, T'mul will inform the party that Ux's mind has been cut
apart, with pieces and memories carved out as if via surgery. Not only are there
memories Ux cannot recall, but the open wounds from their absense will cause him
intense, blinding agony whenever he even tries to remember them. However, in
many places he noticed distinct, artificial etchings in Ux's mental topography.
Based on some of his past research, T'mul believes these etchings were part of
an enchanted item used to interface with the mind. It is possible that artifact
could hold the key to repairing his mind.

T'mul does not know exactly what the artifact could be or would look like.
However, based on a surface level understanding of what it likely does, he would
expect that the artifact is likely a crown, circlet, or hat of some sort,
composed largely of copper, and maybe containing some larimar fittings.

## The Hunt for the Crown

After learning about the crown, the party will be tasked with locating it. Their
search will take them to six of the eight noble houses of Haatz, allowing the
party to get a feel and impression of the complexity of the Haatzan political
system. 

[[a|The Path of the Crown]]: Months ago, Eligi, a gnome antiquarian of pre-
Atzivecan artifacts, discovered a copper circlet with larimar fittings forgotten
in his shop, when, Chimuva Hrel, a servant of House Ixmuca, found and purchased
it for her lady. A few weeks later, as part of a payment for House Kisin
poisoning lord Hrelak Uyakil, a lesser noble and vassal of House Uaynih who
embarassed Lady Mental by wearing a wig many considered superior to Lady Mental,
Lord Lemuhl Kisin accepted the crown from House Ixmuca. 

Lemuhl purchased the crown for his love interest, Lady Kiraza Kahau. He could
not give a gift which could be easily traced to House Kisin for fear their
secret relationship would be discovered. Also wanting to keep the relationship
a secret, Lady Kiraza had the crown taken to the family's country home in Ulitz.
However, the caravan was raided by the Summer Suns Gang, who were hired by
Lord Tlatoani to retrieve the crown.

### Starting the Hunt: The Antiquarian

Asking around for a crown requires the party to `Gather Information (DC 15)`. On
a success, the party learns that the most likely location for information on the
crown would be within House Steelgad's sales archives, as merchants are required
to document any sale, purchase, or recovery of any jewels, gems, or jewelry with
House Steelgad at the top of each month. If a merchant of the city has the
crown, it should be recorded with them. The party can then progress with looking
at the [[l|Steelgad Records]].

If the Gather Information check succeeds by 15 or more, the investigation will
lead the party to discover that the Eligi, a gnome antiquarian of pre-Atzivecan
goods in the city, mentioned he sold a crown a few months ago. Eligi mentioned
the story because he had no memory of where the crown came from, and he
remembers where everything in his shop came from.

[[a|Steelgad Records]]: The Steelgad records hall is located in the Hawkperch
district. The records hall is maintained by a dwarf commoner (`Will DC 23`)
named Kovraga Steelgad (f dw ma). The Steelgad records hold an acount of all
transactions involving masonry, ore, metal, gems, and precious stones, including
metal jewelry (though not gem-encrusted clothes). These records are extensive,
maintained and compiled each month to analyze and track the prices of those
goods within the city. These records are not available to the public, and
Kovraga is not inclined to break the rules.

If the party wishes, they can find [[l|Bodi Steelgad|haatz::Bodi]] in 
[[l|The Rose-Scented Flute|haatz::The Rose-Scented Flute]], deep in wine and
debauchery. If they indulge with him for a time, he will take a liking to them
and be more than willing to let them take a look at the boring old records if
they want. He will sign a writ giving them access to the records.

The party can `Purse a Lead (DC 20 Society)` on the crown while looking through
the records, or ask Kovraga to search for what they are looking for herself. In
the former case, the activity takes 30 minutes per check, and, in the latter
case, it takes 2 hours for Kovraga to find what they are looking for. In either
event, once completed, the party learns that the crown was sold to Chimuva Hrel,
in the name of House Ixmuca, from the antiquarian Eligi.

If the party searches for themselves and gets a critical success on the check,
they also learn that Eligi registered the crown (paying the appropriate fee) in
the same report he listed the sale of the crown. This there is no accounting for
where the crown came from, even though the records do make a listing of all
jewelry salvaged from before the Atzivecan Empire. 

[[a|Eligi the Antiquarian]]: Eligi (m gn e) is a retired curator for House Kat,
and he runs his shop out of his home in Lanterntown. After retiring from House
Kat, he has used his pension to purchase pre-Atzivecan antiques from noble
houses seeking to offload their trinkets. He regularly resells the trinkets to
the houses for further events, turning a modest profit with each transaction,
which has supplemented his pension and allowed him to live comfortably while
still amassing a sizeable collection.

Despite his age, Eligi has a keen memory for all the items in his collection.
He knows exactly where every one of his antiques are, how he first got them, and
every time he has sold / bought-back them. With this memory, he finds it strange
and concerning that he has no memory of where the crown came from, or how it
came to be in his shop. One day, Chimuva Hrel, a regular customer from House
Ixmuca who always brings delicious papaya jam and toast on each of her visits
&mdash;she's a lovely young woman who, despite being dedicated to her job, still
manages to find time for the important things in life. She's always eager to
listen to him tell her about the most interesting items in his collection. Like
one of the forks in his collection, which, based on the engraving around the
ha&mdash;

Oh. Yes. The circlet. Well Chimuva purchased it a few months ago for her lady,
who wanted it for one of her wigs for a party.
